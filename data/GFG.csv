<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This movie consists mostly of us watching previously known characters doing whatever theyre doing now, meandering nowhere plot wise, while getting in random tight spots . For some reason they believed fans want to see a repeat of 1st movie and its characters instead of a new quality story and interesting content. Also EVERY SINGLE tight spot they find themselves in with dinosaurs is same formula.<br/><br/>Its always exactly as it has been in every Jurassic film. Big problem all of a sudden, slow moving dino watching someone or breathing around them, then dino gives chase, uff! They barely escaped but escape they did!<br/><br/>It is so dull and predicatable.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we meet two new types of characters, a) those who are just inherently evil b) those who do evil stuff but are really good and moral. You can tell them apart easily by looking at what theyre wearing and whether its a rich straight white guy.<br/><br/>The story is dumb and their evil plan so on the nose it is humorous. Zero imagination when writing the script. The length of it fits on half a napkin.<br/><br/>After 80% of the movie is finished and we have gone over the revisiting our ""favourite"" Jurassic characters and our classic Jurassic scenes phase, the predictable ending occurs.<br/><br/>And you realize the movie was as a wonderful and full of quality content as a dino fart.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.<br/><br/>That's not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that's one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.<br/><br/>On top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it's because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don't feel any kind of magic.<br/><br/>Some parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn't the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring. I had 8 hours of sleep last night and drank a Red Bull, yet I was struggling to stay awake. I had to un-recline.<br/><br/>All of the action scenes are forgettable. Literally. It's only been a few hours and I can remember maybe a couple cool moments. And one thing I couldn't believe, the climax action sequence is straight-up copied from one of the previous movies. I won't say which one, but I'm baffled they went this route. It's even sadder when you realize it's worse than what it copied in every way.<br/><br/>As for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off. I don't think it's poor CGI but something about it doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>I am so disappointed this is what they gave us for their self-proclaimed ""epic conclusion of the Jurassic era."" Especially after Fallen Kingdom left us with such an exciting cliffhanger, the chaos that awaits the people of the world when dinosaurs are unleashed upon them. That's not at all what we get.<br/><br/>I loved the first Jurassic World. And while the second is highly flawed, it's still entertaining and filled with tension and suspense. I felt none of that with Dominion. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 6/9/2022)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Colin Trevorrow was so preoccupied with weather he could squeeze all his ideas into a film, he didn't stop to think if he should try and squeeze them all into his film. The narrative is so overstuffed it would fill a Mosasaurus, the action frustratingly lacks any kind of tension, horror or real threat to the main characters and the occasional call backs seen in JW and JW:FK are now as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. That's not to say its a bad film, there's some excellent character moments with the original cast and Jeff Goldblum is brilliant, injecting some much needed humour into this otherwise pretty dry sequel. Being a huge JP fan, this could simply be a case of high expectations getting the better of me but the lack of exhilaration and awe upon leaving the cinema is painful.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.<br/><br/>So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.<br/><br/>I have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I don't know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>This didn't happen.<br/><br/>No matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.<br/><br/>Dominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.<br/><br/>Not only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.<br/><br/>Speaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.<br/><br/>The problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.<br/><br/>A lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honestly, I could have adapted any number of great Dr. Malcolm quotes from the other films to title this review, but this one perhaps sums it up best. (Be warned. I have a lot to say, so if you dislike long reviews, skip ahead now.)<br/><br/>Here's where I'm coming from:<br/><br/>1. Loved Jurassic Park, of course.<br/><br/>2. Enjoyed Lost World but disappointed by its missed potential.<br/><br/>3. LIKED Jurassic Park III (that's right, I'm the guy).<br/><br/>4. Admired Jurassic World for recreating some of the awe of the original with a slight twist.<br/><br/>5. Frustrated with Fallen Kingdom's disjointed structure and simplistic characters but its cliffhanger ending left me optimistic for the future.<br/><br/>6. Dominion... Well, another Malcolm quote sums it up: ""That is one big pile of s**t.""<br/><br/>The Jurassic World trilogy unfortunately has been one of diminishing returns. The first (JW) was a reimaging of the 1993 original (not unlike The Force Awakens was to A New Hope), but with an understanding of modern cynicism and apathy. An early line of dialogue summed up the theme: ""No one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore."" Genetically creating a new scarier hybrid dinosaur was an interesting angle, as it kept the scientific focus of the original but provided a meta commentary not just on the JP franchise but on all Hollywood monster movies. While it was no masterpiece, Colin Trevorrow gave a new idea to ponder alongside the dinos, which neither Lost World nor JP III did.<br/><br/>Fallen Kingdom was very messy. Since JW resolved its plot quite well, new storylines and characters were created out of thin air, and logic was pretty much thrown out the window. John Hammond had a partner? The island houses an active volcano? Human cloning going back years? Claire now works for PETA for dinosaurs? The last surviving raptor is John McClane? A Freddy Krueger like dinosaur was created that hunts children in their beds for the purpose of...military combat? Yet, for all of Fallen Kingdom's problems, J. A. Bayona at least gave us some new atmosphere and ended on an intriguing note. By releasing the dinosaurs into the mainland, the door was left open for a number of interesting directions to take the final film.<br/><br/>What's baffling about Dominion is how it manages, at great effort, to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory (pardon the pun). It was supposed to be the franchise's grand denouement. The set up was there--a fastball down the middle --and instead of a homer they hit a long popup to left field while the audience waits with increasing disappointment for the inevitable catch. I didn't care to research what went wrong with Dominion's planning process, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were multiple scripts with different ideas, and Trevorrow (back in the director's chair, and again one of the writers) decided ""let's use them all!...except for the one that examines the logistics of dinosaurs living amongst humans...that one can be trashed.""<br/><br/>As other reviewers have discussed, dinosaurs are merely tangential to Dominion's messy plot. For much of the 2 1/2 hour runtime, it's easy to forget about them, since instead the film decides to focus on...the human characters (and locusts?). Aside from the original, the JP movies have had a consistent problem with its human roles, most either being annoying, doing inexplicably stupid things (even the good guys, Nick Van Owen, anyone?), or just being plain boring. It's the last one that hurts Dominion the most.<br/><br/>In JW, Owen (Pratt) and Claire (Howard) were stereotypical but capable leads with some humorous interactions. Fallen Kingdom stripped away most of Owen's charisma and gave Claire's personality an unwelcome 180. In Dominion, Owen is now Generic Action Hero, and Claire has made a full transformation from Take-Charge Corporate Executive to a worried mother (over a child who isn't hers) who screams and panics a lot with Dr. Ellie Sattler (Dern) when encountering bugs. So much for women inherit the earth. Maisie (Sermon) also returns from Fallen Kingdom. Sadly, instead of focusing on her grappling with being the first human clone, they've reduced her to an unlikeable angsty teen who serves as a MacGuffin for the others after she's kidnapped by the bad guys for reasons not entirely clear.<br/><br/>Bringing back the original cast is pointless if you give them nothing interesting to do. Dr. Grant (Neill) is perhaps the saddest case. In the 20 years since we've last seen him he is still digging up dinosaur fossils and apparently has done nothing else with his life. He has fallen from an intelligent, capable leader to a clueless figure who mostly follows others around looking as confused and bored as the audience. Dern as Dr. Sattler fares the best; she is given the most to do and tries to inject life into the nonsensical plot. Goldblum as Dr. Malcolm is a welcome return, but our favorite nonconformist chaotician would NEVER go work for a genetics lab. Near the film's end he provides an amusing commentary on the movie's absurdity (e.g., his deadpan to Pratt: ""You made a promise to a dinosaur?"")<br/><br/>Two more returning roles need mention. One of the more interesting things JW and Fallen Kingdom did was bring back Dr. Wu (B. D. Wong), making him a brilliant but self-indulgent geneticist. Wong sold it very well and it seemed like a natural progression for his character. He felt Hammond never gave him the respect he deserved (like Nedry), so he became determined to make bigger and greater accomplishments (i.e., hybrid monsters) than his former boss, unabashedly and at any cost. It was an interesting heel turn, making Dr. Wu (while never a major role) the most believable human antagonist of the series. Instead of resolving Wu's villainous arc, Dominion inexplicably reverses course and strips him of his hubris. Looking ungodly sick, Wu gives a mea culpa to Maisie for his creation of...giant locusts. No mention of his regret for recklessly creating the hybrid killing machines in the last two movies. Another good set-up from prior movies wasted.<br/><br/>And then there's Dr. Dodgson (Scott). JP enthusiasts will remember the character's cameo in the first JP as the competing geneticist who hires Nedry to steal the embryos. And true fans know he played a more prominent role in the second novel. It seemed like an inspired choice to bring back Dodgson, a villain who connects to the plot of the first film and, by proxy, to its three returning heroes. Yet, in his interactions in Dominion with Sattler, Grant, and Malcolm, they never learn of his involvement in JP. Indeed, even Dodgson doesn't seem aware that they were involved in JP, although his character should certainly know that. But for a quick shot of the infamous muddied Barbasol can in his office, you could completely forget who he is. He acts more like an eccentric Steve Jobs with only one foot in reality than the cutthroat scientist he should be. ""We've got Dodgson here!""...yet ""nobody cares."" Nedry was right.<br/><br/>If you've read up to this point (congratulations), you'll note I've barely mentioned the dinosaurs. Say what you will about the other movies, but at least they were all about the dinos. Many had distinct personalities that made them terrifying. One of Fallen Kingdom's mistakes was recrafting the sole surviving raptor (the villains of the first JP) as the hero, and raptors are no longer scary. Dominion goes further. Now the raptor (Blue) has reproduced (don't ask) and is a doting mother. There's no menace, and, further, Blue is sidelined for most of the film.<br/><br/>Yes, there are dinosaurs, including other types of raptors. Dominion takes Fallen Kingdom's lame concept of laser-guided raptors and embraces it, resulting in a motorcycle/cargo plane chase through Malta that, while visually impressive (and welcome as the first action sequence 45 minutes in), belongs in a Bond or Bourne movie. (Dominion hops across several genres.)<br/><br/>Where these never-before-seen dinosaurs came from is unknown. No more than 50 were released in Fallen Kingdom, and these new species were not among them. No explanation...moving on. Some new dinos in Dodgson's ""animal preserve"" (*cough* new park) seem interesting, although we don't know anything about them. To the film's credit, there is a tensely shot sequence involving Claire hiding in a lake from a spine-chilling carnivore. It's the closest Dominion comes to recreating the quiet fear of the original, and it's due to the movie deciding to slow down and take a welcome breath.<br/><br/>Though why this lake is liquid when another lake in the same general area and time is frozen over enough to walk on shows a lack of continuity. It feels as though the creative team became entirely overwhelmed with the snowballing plot threads and characters that inconsistencies like this became commonplace. Trevorrow reportedly was pleased Covid delayed the film's release a year because it would allow them more time in post-production, yet with the uneven editing and overall breakneck pace, you wouldn't know it. They had extra time to edit together a cohesive, understandable plot and failed to do so.<br/><br/>But Dominion's biggest sin is that it simply isn't scary. Aside from the noted lake sequence, there is no terror, no dread, no sense of dangerous awe. A new apex predator bigger than the T-Rex is supposed to frighten us. It doesn't. When the paths of the JP leads and JW leads finally merge while cornered by the big dinos, they act like they're in peril, but we don't buy it. We don't believe any of these stars will die (they don't), and we're not invested enough in them to care anyway. The characters lack agency, and it's boring. Dominion mostly swaps quiet scenes of terror of humans using their wits to face off against dinos (e.g., JP's T-Rex escape, raptors in the kitchen) for interchangeable dinos fighting each other in yawn-inducing brawls.<br/><br/>During one of these, Dr. Grant notes aloud: ""This isn't about us."" How true, and how sad. Dominion fails to exert dominion over itself.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I will say this for Colin Trevorrow: unlike other Hollywood writers/directors, who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to, when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park, I believe him.<br/><br/>That's why Jurassic World Dominion feels, for good and for ill, like the world's most expensive fan film, cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character, meme and in-joke from the previous five movies (button up your shirt, Malcom! Get your hat, Grant! Oh look, Nedry's old Barbasol can!).<br/><br/>I'm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the face.<br/><br/>The movie is at least twenty minutes too long - Hollywood seems incapable to make a non-bloated blockbuster today, even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line - and it doesn't have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park, but I did like a few set-pieces (the Therizinosaurus, the frozen lake...) and it's always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back, so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent.<br/><br/>6/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level. The action, the editing, the direction, it's all terrible. The movie has no focus, too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of ""real"" props for some of the dinosaurs, so it's not like the actors are always looking at a green screen. However, everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie. Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab because they knew idiots like myself would go and see it. Oh well. Just Hollywood doing what they do best.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I absolutely hated this film... legacy characters used as bait for box office numbers, a horrible plot that makes the incredibly long runtime absolutely insufferable. The actors aren't at fault, the visuals are good (as you might expect from a movie this expensive), but the script is atrocious, and ""the epic conclusion"" is not very much a conclusion, the main issue is not solved, and everything that was wrong in the previous films is just elevated in this film, absolutely terrible film, don't watch it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic movies. The original was excellent and fun. This was an excuse to have a reunion. The movie can't stand on its own. I watched it with someone who had never seen any of the previous Jurassic movies. He didn't get it. I thought we were passed films that allowed the stars to keep their makeup on after swimming through algea covered ponds. Not even camp enough to be fun.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World Dominion feels like it became a self-parody during the first act of the movie. Sure it's nice that they're referencing the past movies in kind, but the lapses in logic, the annoying deus-ex machinas at play, the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earth's everyday socioeconomic hemisphere: it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen Kingdom.<br/><br/>There was potential here: uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts, uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival, and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually co-exist alongside people.<br/><br/>The Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time: but I think we KNOW Universal's are least considering another sequel to this 'conclusion'.<br/><br/>What next? Jurassic Stars? Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outer-space or something? At least that'd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon.</div>

In what promises to be the conclusion to the series, all the main cast members of the previous shows are here. ""Alan Grant....... Ellie Sattler"", I actually liked the new characters. DaWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie better than the old ones - they are the only ones that come out of this unscathed. The special effects are, as expected, first class although really? A Gigilomopoloposaurus??? - they just keep getting bigger (the dinosaurs AND the names). Not sure that it's worth the Hollywood Blvd/Times Sq ticket prices ($20+) , but it's an okay way to spend a summer afternoon. I think tho, I'd wait til next weekend when the crowds will be 65% less.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am a big fan of the franchise, specially the two original films directed by Spielberg and based on Chriton's books. Jurassic Park is the film of my childhood, but enough is enough.<br/><br/>The last two films lost it way completely. This one has a couple of really nice action sequences, but leaves us with the feeling there are more locusts and humans in scene than dinosaurs, despite the myriad of species featured, they get displicent attention and really short screen time in a plot deficient story.<br/><br/>It is sad to have to admit it, but it's high time they leave the franchise in peace. I hope this is the final one. The only reason I give it an average 6 is for the return of the original cast, the dylophosaurs and pure sentimental value.<br/><br/>But this was quite disappointing and one more missed opportunity.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World Dominion is the third and final film in the Jurassic Park/World franchise. And what we get is great visuals, fun action, good performances, and nostalgia from the series. But at the cost of a good story.<br/><br/>The good in this movie is of course the visuals. They are outstanding. The dinosaurs look great, and it's a true spectacle. The action too is really good. It may not be the best in the series, but it's fun and exciting. The performances are also pretty good. Isabella Sermon is a lot better here than in the last film. She is actually pretty funny here. The new characters brought in are for the most part pretty good. But the returning cast is great. Jeff Goldblum is very funny here. The overall nostalgia in the movie is quite nice. And finally the pace of the movie moves nicely to be entertaining.<br/><br/>But the story here is not very good. This movie isn't bad, but the story could've made it worse. The premise doesn't live up to the promise that the last film set up. The villains here are pretty bad. They're not threatening at all, and pretty forgettable. The movie also has a messy narrative as it jumps from one place to another. Overall this is the most disappointing film in the series.<br/><br/>Overall Jurassic World: Dominion suffers from a weak story, forgettable villains, and a messy narrative, but it's saved thanks to great visuals, fun action, good performances, and nice nostalgia from the series. This may be the most disappointing film in the series, but it's far from the worst.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Colin Trevorrow has managed to make himself the Ryan Johnson of the Jurassic Park franchise with this film and the vanity with which he promoted and defended it. Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It's a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.<br/><br/>The film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for ""rescue"". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of ""Dogson!"". We've got Dodgson here"" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry's dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the ""heroes"" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.<br/><br/>By the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that's how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one's own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn't Trevorrow write a scene in which it's made clear that Lockwood didn't know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn't care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.<br/><br/>The plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it's overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she's been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.<br/><br/>BD Wong's character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.<br/><br/>Unbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let's not forget that Dearing and Grady's love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality....
One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth's history.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history. Tragic.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">6th film in the Jurassic series that brings back the main 3 actors of the original Jurassic Park movies to share the screen with the main actors of the Jurassic World Movies to give a grand sent off to the entire series. Unfortunately, both sets of actors are split up in two completely different stories that combine towards the climax and one of the stories ( The one with Neil, Dern and Goldblum) is ten times more interesting than the other one ( The one with Pratt and Howard). In fact, with a heavy rewrite and a better director at the helm, the story involving the original Jurassic Park characters would have a been a very good Jurassic Sequel on its own right. Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world, so we are stuck with a another bad Jurassic World sequel that does not know on what it wants to be .<br/><br/>The story involving the original Jurassic Park cast is actual a very interesting one that involves corporate espionage and genetic engineering. A story on which if it had a stronger screenplay, a better director and a direct focus on what this series is really about , it would have been a great continuation of Michael Crichton's work and a great bookend to Steven Spielberg's first two Jurassic Park films (The original and it's only true and worthy sequel ""The Lost World""). Unfortunately under Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly dimwitted screenplay, the story only scratches the surface of the subject matter and is shoehorned to run parallel with the other story in this movie, which is not very thought out and is really pretty bad . Fortunately for the audience, the characters of Alan Grant , Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm are as endearing as ever and the actors are having a fun. Jeff Goldblum can read a phone book and make it interesting, intelligent, funny and entertaining. His character's sarcastic wit is so on point in certain scenes that you end up thinking that Jeff is trying to break the 4th wall to let the audience know on how he really feels about this movie. Sam Neill is great as well, making a welcome return to his character and he actually looks happy to be in this film ( A far cry from the tired performance he gave in the horrible ""Jurassic Park 3"" but who can blame him) and Lara Dern is as intelligent, spunky and sassy as ever. The charisma and chemistry of all three of the returning Jurassic Park actors more than make up for the half baked plot line they are working with.<br/><br/>The same can't be said for the returning Jurassic World actors, whose plot line is a direct sequel to the events of the horrible ""Fallen Kingdom"" and it does not help that both Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard look disinterested in their roles. Pratt, who was a welcome addition in ""Jurassic World"" just looks tired and bored here and Howard, (who in my opinion had a harder character to play and that reason being is the fact that her character changes personalities from one film to the next ) looks ready to move on from this franchise. Their story involving the kidnapping of the clone child of ""Fallen Kingdom"" and Blue's own baby raptor is so bad that it's an anchor over the neck of this movie. Their story ends up as a bad rip off of the Jason Bourne series. You have shady bad guys, bad stereotypes, a unbelievable plane crash and a fight with dinosaurs in a city (Anybody who still crying over the T-Rex in San Diego in ""The Lost World"" should keep their mouths shut after they see this terrible sequence in this film). Not to mention the characters striking super hero poses in certain scenes, which makes this story impossible to take seriously. Fortunately or unfortunately if you think about it, the two parallel stories connect towards the climax and our heroes meet for the first time. Which is also eye opening because you can see how shallow the characters from ""Jurassic World"" are compared to the characters of ""Jurassic Park"". Not to mention the fact that the ""Park"" actors are making an effort to bring something to this mess while the ""World"" actors are just going through the motions.<br/><br/>Which is a shame because Neil, Dern and Goldblum remind the audience on why the original Jurassic Park is such a class act and that was because it had great characters and great actors behind them. Unfortunately, not even their Herculean efforts can stop this film for being crushed by the weight of its own stupidity.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""Jurassic World Dominion"" is a movie I genuinely don't know how to feel about. Parts of me really liked it, and other parts were very critical and disappointed in it. It's one I might have to see again to really firm up my opinion. Regardless... I had fun with this movie. I just want to make it clear it is nowhere near as bad as some people say it is; it's not perfect, but it is still lots of fun! However this is definitely the weakest in the ""Jurassic World"" trilogy, but I am someone who loved ""Jurassic World"" and for the most part really liked ""Fallen Kingdom"". I have to say, I did like this more than the original sequels to ""Jurassic Park"", and I thought this did serve as a nice finale to the series, even if it has changed substantially.<br/><br/>I think my biggest issue here was how different it was from what I wanted and expected to see coming off the ending of ""Fallen Kingdom"", but I can't blame the movie for that. I feel like there were many more interesting stories that could've been told here, but what we got was okay. It just makes me want to see more from this world at this time, with the dinosaurs being out in the world it leaves a lot of potential stories open to be told! This story, however, was very poorly told. It was exceptionally weakly written, and was not compelling or interesting for much of the film. I normally get into films pretty easily, but it took me a good 45 minutes to get into this one. The script even felt like fan-fiction at times, and never really sold me on what was going on. The script has no emotion to it, the audience has no emotional connection to the characters (even the old ones) and I felt like I didn't really care what happened in multiple instances. The cloning problem... the locusts... Biosyn... it's just all sort of there... and the film is very much an overstuffed jumble of characters and plotlines.<br/><br/>The most heinous crime however: the fact that this film normalizes dinosaurs being in the world. Because of this, we lose the awe and wonder of seeing dinosaurs alongside the characters, a feeling that has been present in every ""Jurassic"" film until now. Not only that, but we also lose the scare factor that makes these films so great. There's no suspense, no tension, just straight action. Every dinosaur scene doesn't feel as threatening as it should... and there's a moment in the finale that is a prime example of this. I also did not love the locusts plot... took way too much away from the dinosaurs. Like... this is a dinosaur movie right? In the (paraphrased) words of Ian Malcolm: Do you plan to have dinosaurs in your dinosaur movie? The script does not balance itself well either, the characters have no compelling drama or story and the dinosaurs don't either... it just feels hollow. Where are all the big ideas about genetic experimentation and natural consequences? I also found the film to be both too long and not long enough. There are way too many characters, and half are unnecessary, they just take up screen time. And one other thing... WHY WASN'T THE PROLOGUE IN THE FILM?! They released this great 5 minute sequence as advertising last year, saying it was the prologue to the film, and yet the movie instead starts with an abysmally executed ""last time on Jurassic World..."" kind of recap. Having the prologue in solves a whole ton of the issues I have with the film; it mirrors the end in interesting ways and sets up some conflicts, as well as shows an interesting scene that is mentioned multiple times throughout the film. Plus it's a much more entertaining way to begin the film.<br/><br/>Okay... one more bad to go. Colin Trevorrow's direction. He genuinely did a terrible job here. It was so bland and had no style, it lost all Spielbergian charm he may have had when doing the first ""Jurassic World"". JA Bayona at least brought excellent gothic horror stylings to ""Fallen Kingdom"" which really made it feel horrific... and then we go to this bland, generic stuff. Nothing sticks out, it's just generic blockbuster filmmaking. Sure there are a few interesting visuals and a final montage that I love, but I'm sure under a different direction they would be even better.<br/><br/>Now, you might be wondering: after all those criticisms, how did you still enjoy it? Well, despite it not being what I wanted and being a very flawed film, it was at least fun! I was entertained, there was some cool Dino stuff, some fun action set-pieces, and I loved that the production team committed to using more animatronics for the dinosaurs. It just helped make them feel more authentic! I also LOVED the return of the original cast, and was so happy to see they actually played major roles in the plot. Plus, the new cast from the current films wasn't half-bad either. I also loved how the human villain is technically from the first film, and there were some many great nods to the original ""Jurassic Park""! Speaking of the villain... Biosyn is literally an evil Apple, and Dodgson is literally an evil Tim Cook... right down to the look! I loved this sly critique of modern capitalist culture, and how many companies (especially in the tech sector) behave. There were also some really cool visual sequences, and the sound in this movie was great! I also loved Michael Giacchino's score! He did a lot of the heavy lifting for the emotion of the film, trying his best to make it resonate with music where the screenplay couldn't. And by god it worked! This score really did elevate so many moments for me, and used themes from all over!<br/><br/>So while I do think this film is deeply flawed, I enjoyed it! I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about it, but I do know I liked it better than ""Jurassic Park 3""! I would definitely recommend seeing it, especially if you have enjoyed the rest of this franchise. I wouldn't even mind seeing more! There's still a ton of potential for future stories, and I think I would enjoy this even more knowing this is just the beginning of something new. While it is no ""Jurassic Park"", and definitely doesn't have suspense... it is a really fun action blockbuster! If you can get through the 1st act... the last 2/3 are a great time! I loved parts, but some didn't work for me, and yet I would still recommend checking it out! How could you say no to dinosaurs?</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Truly a shameful film made in a hurry and without a plot that is linear or otherwise makes sense. Since Jurassic World in 2015 the Jurassic saga has gone to die, with dinosaurs that were better made in 1993 and with characters that try to retrace the steps of the main protagonists of Jurassic Park but fail to even be iconic for the film itself. Somebody has to stop them, they are ruining a saga that was never supposed to be revived again, it was over in 2001 and I still ask myself now, ""but was it really needed?"" I sincerely hope that this is the last chapter, although I'm afraid not, because really how can you put locusts as the villain of the movie... ARE WE KIDDING? I would have expected anything, but locusts don't. Then there are some characters in particular Henry Wu who in the previous 2 chapters was the villain who created monsters and here instead he wants to save everyone but for no good reason, they don't explain why Wu became good from one moment to the next and this angers people no end. Let's not talk about how they evolved Maisie Lockwood's character because I really found her ridiculous. One of the worst movies of this year, someone needs to stop this CRAZY.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Life once found a way. Now, I hope it loses itself.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion has its positives, namely the fantastic Legacy character's wonderful return and, well, that's it. I enjoyed their presence, especially Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum - the latter who had the best lines, as always. The rest...yeah, I sincerely hope this is the last Jurassic Anything.<br/><br/>All throughout this movie, the word ""Dumb"" just kept popping up in my head. Dumb script. Dumb dialogue. Dumb luck with all the hilariously impossible coincidences. Too many Dumb references to this series and other Steven Spielberg classics. And the two Dumbest characters in the franchise are back: Clone Girl Maisie who hates all mankind for her decision in the last entry and that screaming boy, Franklin, though, THANK GOD, he doesn't scream in this one like all the scenes he ruined in the last one.<br/><br/>With a huge missed opportunity to expand on the actual title of Jurassic World, this hopefully last chapter just has society dealing with dinos killing people and the economy while debating if they should be extinguished. But, never mind that, this series has always been around greed and the ineptest baddie of the franchise with the most hilariously bad security detail is up to no good and only our 1,500 heroes in this movie can stop him!<br/><br/>While the second half is monstrously better than the first half, I still couldn't wait for this movie to be over. Sure, it's better than the two worst sequels: III and Fallen Kingdom, but not by much. Like the Terminator, this franchise should've stopped at #2 in The Lost World.<br/><br/>The movie's absolutely boring, even with multiple action scenes and there are literally no stakes. In fact, I was always hoping throughout the first two acts, they'd have the balls to kill off any of the characters. As much as I would love to see the Legacy characters make it - forgetting about the new Jurassic World characters, never liked them much - at least the movie would've taken chances.<br/><br/>I'm done with this series. Like Transformers 4 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4, even if they make another one (like they did with those franchises,) I won't be watching another one. This was just crap.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Easy listing of the Series. Hint: Only watch the 1st three listed below.<br/><br/>1. Jurassic Park<br/><br/>2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park<br/><br/>3. Jurassic World<br/><br/>97. Jurassic World Dominion<br/><br/>98. Jurassic Park III<br/><br/>99. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Okay so were do i begin? This movie unfortunately just is not good. Story was lame disinteresting, does having the original cast help the movie at all? Umm unfortunately not. Alan doesn't feel like alan grant anymore for some strange reason. In the previous films he was a dinosaur expert and helpful this one you just feel like he's there with no real purpose. Same with Ian malcolm, and ellie. They just serve no real purpose to the story whats so ever they are there just for fan service. This actually makes jurassic park 3 a more fun watch. This just doesn't feel like a jurassic park movie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Despite having the most potential and the original trilogy cast finally returning, Jurassic World: Dominion manages to squander all of that potential in an overly long, pointless mess with no stakes, cheap nostalgia and a level of stupid that's a new low even for this trilogy.<br/><br/>It's constantly swapping ideas and genres in all the worst ways, barely feeling like an actual Jurassic movie. The dinosaurs are barely in it and have little to no effect on the narrative, instead simply used for a few entertaining set pieces and then quickly forgotten.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are somehow given less depth the third time round, making their characters even more forgettable and bland. However, the original cast are obviously great and elevate the extremely weak material given to them.<br/><br/>The music by Michael Giacchino is a huge letdown. It does nothing new and is simply content in repeating all the familiar tunes from previous ones but they're not even integrated well, almost always feeling random and out of place.<br/><br/>However, the film looks nice overall with visuals that are a league above the average blockbuster. There is a lot of satisfying practicality when it comes to the dinosaurs which is really nice to see, even if some look cheap.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I'm going to make this short...Jurassic World: Dominion is like cleaning out your refrigerator and dumping a bunch of stuff in the trash. Only in this case, they decided to dump the ""stuff"" on the screen in this film. Jurassic World: Dominion has a lot of story arcs with no real connection or depth. People are popping in, popping back out, then popping in again, boring us with trite laughable dialogue and no real character development; you don't really care about any of these people. Just when you think there might be something to a scene with the familar charcaters, CUT TO another scene with no set-up. This film is like watching a 3:00 AM B-movie that is so bad, it does its job by putting you back to sleep. And let's talk about the dinosaurs, velociraptors and various man-eating prehistoric creatures...nah, it's not worth it because other than the penultimate scene where the biggest and baddest were going at each other, they were simply an after-thought. Go figure.<br/><br/>Everyone connected to this film tried to do too much and it didn't work as far as the storytelling is concerned. As I said before, they emptied the refrigerator and threw in everything in this film and it left a bad taste in my mouth because there was just too much ""stuff.""</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">A Jurassic Park and Jurassic World mish mash. I could go on and on but I'm tired after struggling through the movie. Using the same old ideas, putting the same old actors with some new ones and adding lots of computer graphics does not mean its will be a good movie. Bigger dinosaurs with more noise is just BORING. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The scariest part of the movie is that it is doing well at the box-office, so there will probably be another bad sequel. Jurassic Universe - or Multiverse??? Please, think it through or just let it die.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Essentially ""Jurassic World Dominion"" is just a rather weak storyline based on nostalgia and following the same formula throughout the course of the entire movie.<br/><br/>But I am getting ahead of myself here. Sure, I was thrilled to sit down and watch the 2022 movie ""Jurassic World Dominion"", as a conclusion to the movies. And I will say that the movie definitely was off with a bang.<br/><br/>The storyline in ""Jurassic World Dominion"", as written by Emily Carmichael, Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly was a bit weak. And by that I mean it wasn't a rather wholesome or particularly profound and deep storyline here. It was essentially just taking the protagonists of the movie, which now included members of the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, members of the ""Jurassic World"" trilogy and some new ones, and having them move from A to B while intercepted by a dangerous dinosaur, then move from B to C while intercepted by a dangerous dinosaur, and moving from C to D while intercepted by, and you guessed it, a dangerous dinosaur but also by oversized mutated locusts this time.<br/><br/>The writers cater a lot to viewers of the original trilogy with lots of props and events that you can recognize if you have watched and enjoyed the first trilogy. And sure, it does work, but it just becomes a little bit tacky as the movie progresses. But at the same time it was also somewhat enjoyable to watch things again on the screen that was seen or done in other movies in the franchise, sort of the circling being completed in a way.<br/><br/>Visually then ""Jurassic World Dominion"" was phenomenal. The special effects and CGI team really are working magic to brink the dinosaurs and the world to life. I enjoyed this CGI extravagance, and it is actually a major part of the movie. If a movie like ""Jurassic World Dominion"" had dubious CGI, it just wouldn't work. But luckily the CGI here is amazing to look at; pure eye-candy.<br/><br/>The movie does have a good cast ensemble. It is a cast ensemble that unites the members of the original trilogy with those of the new trilogy; so you have Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum teaming up with Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Isabella Sermon. And the movie also have a wonderful appearance by BD Wong, and also by DeWanda Wise. I am not sure about whether or not I really liked Campbell Scott's part in the movie, sure I liked his performance, but the character was just too much something resembling Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>""Jurassic World Dominion"" is a movie that is worth watching if you have enjoyed the five previous movies, of course it is. And it is entertaining enough for what it turns out to be. Sure, I wasn't expecting director Colin Trevorrow to re-invent the wheel here with this 2022 action adventure. If for nothing else, then watch ""Jurassic World Dominion"" for the special effects and CGI.<br/><br/>The whole concept of humans and the wildlife of today's world coexisting with dinosaurs was just a bit far fetched for my liking. But hey, it looked good - and sappy - on the screen.<br/><br/>My rating of ""Jurassic World Dominion"" lands on a solid six out of ten stars. It is definitely well worth the time.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I loved the first Jurassic Park (1993) film and still think it's an amazingly enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, every entry after is never as good or even downright bad. Jurassic World Dominion is the final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and the one that unites the cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World together. To see the return of the main trio from Jurassic Park was the biggest reason I was looking forward to this film. Does Jurassic World Dominion stick the landing or is it just a big pile of s#*%?<br/><br/>One thing that the Jurassic World franchise has done better and better is the visuals. Jurassic World Dominion has no doubt the best visuals and cinematography of all the films so far. There are some pretty great shots of dinosaurs without a doubt. There are also some pretty fun action sequences. For example, in Malta where dinosaurs are chasing Chris Pratt and Bryce throughout the city. The part in Malta also explores the black market of Dinosaurs and that was pretty interesting. One pretty annoying issue with the Jurassic World franchise is the lack of animatronics but Dominion uses a lot of animatronics. I appreciated it as it made the Dinosaurs feel a bit more real when they were being interacted with.<br/><br/>My biggest reason for watching was the OG cast and it was great seeing all of them together again. Laura Dern and Sam Neill are great together as Ellie Satler and Alan Grant respectively. Both of them don't phone it in and it feels like the same characters we last saw 21 years ago. My favourite is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and he just steals every scene he is in. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard also return and they are fine. The movie introduces some new characters and one of them is Kayla played by DeWanda Wise. DeWanda is great and a real standout in the film thanks to her charismatic performance. Kayla ends up being a fun character to watch thanks to her coolness and natural reaction to all the craziness happening.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is very difficult to like. My biggest annoyance is the plot. There are two plot lines, one with Chris Pratt involving a kidnapping of Maisie (the clone daughter from the previous film) and another with the OG cast which just features them snooping around a big corporation. One of the plotlines is more exciting and interesting while also resulting in thrilling dinosaur action. The OG cast plotline is just so boring, goofy and just dumb. It's a shame that the OG cast was done dirty like that. The movie feels like two different movies shoved into one leading to two different stories with different tones. The main story also features this plot device concerning locusts and it's just really stupid.<br/><br/>The movie also features a sort of new human villain in Dodgson played by Campbell Scott. I say sort of new because he is technically playing the same character that was briefly in the first Jurassic Park film albeit it's a different actor now. He is just a very underwhelming villain. He is just not that interesting or threatening. They also have a new dinosaur villain in the Giganotosaurus and it also sucks. It barely has any screen time and is not even as scary as any of the previous dinosaur villains. There is also another new character introduced called Ramsay played by Mamoudou Athie who I think does a good job in the role. What makes his character is his supposed relationship with Dodgson which is mentioned a couple of times. However, it is barely explored yet for some reason is put into the film like it is an emotional or important element and it was just baffling.<br/><br/>Maisie returns from the previous film and has become incredibly unlikeable. I'm not a big fan of bratty kid characters, especially ones that cause the deaths of dozens of innocent people. Her character is written poorly and I do think the actress gives a pretty weak performance which doesn't help. The movie is also way too long with its runtime being 146 minutes. A majority of the runtime is just boring human stuff with maybe 15-20 minutes of some dinosaur stuff. The original Jurassic Park cast and the new Jurassic World cast don't even meet until the final act. Once they meet, it feels very anti-climatic and unnatural, it just sort of happens. I'm gutted that the movie wastes an interesting idea in exploring the consequences of dinosaurs being released into the world and how the world deals with it. Instead, this idea is just brushed over within the first 5 minutes. The film doesn't do anything original and just does dinosaurs on an island again! The movie doesn't even spend time dealing with the message that the film starts with which is can humans and dinosaurs coexist? The film just ends with this magically being answered and resolved with no explanation how?<br/><br/>Overall, what a massive disappointment. While I didn't particularly enjoy Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the movie ends on a fascinating note that could've made for an amazing 3rd film. Regrettably, Jurassic World Dominion ends up being more interested in being a cheap, cheesy, B movie action thrill and even then it doesn't do that great either. I'm devastated that the so-called Avengers of the Jurassic franchise is just a very mediocre and underwhelming dinosaur movie. I ended up feeling like it was time for this franchise to go extinct. As Ian once said, ""that's one big pile of s#*%"".</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Old cast meets new cast. That right there alone was worth the admission. Good villains, good heroes, good action scenes, good ending scene for most.<br/><br/>Where I'd like to see this continuing on as is with the next era of species being added. If humans are now living with Dinosaurs regularly... may as well add Mammoths, Sabertooth Tigers, and so forth. Perhaps the popular topic of global warming leads to some sort of ice age and we have not only a crossover of species but another end of the world type movie thrown in... I'd watch it. Jurassic Park meets 10,000BC, meets 2012.<br/><br/>Much like most other long running franchises I'm sure the band would get back together for something like that.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Easily my least favorite movie in the Jurassic Park saga. Absolutely horrible on ever level and a fundamental misunderstanding at what makes this saga so interesting. Trevorrow had no clue what he was doing with this movie. He was told to make the final film in a six movie saga and said to himself ""Hmm let's not focus on the dinosaurs in this FINAL FILM"". How do you not understand what people want to see these movies for. You need to actually focus on the dinosaurs or you are not gonna keep peoples attention and I feel that is what happened here. Instead the film focuses on giant locusts? Why is this so interesting that you need to sideline the dinosaurs for it. I didn't want to see an espionage story about kidnapping, locusts, and clones. I just want to see what the world would be like if dinosaurs took over which we don't see either. The main issue that happened in the previous film that CHANGED THE STATUS QUO is barely focused on besides a few scenes. It's baffling why they would do this. Not even the original cast can save this. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill seem like they are having fun but the dialogue they are given is horrendous. The dialogue in general is bad but they got it the worst. The whole cast generally doesn't seem to be trying besides Neill and Goldblum. Everyone felt very low energy and if they didn't want to be there. The villain gave the worst performance in the film. They just let that guy spitball all these awkward lines and just didn't know when to say cut. The film feels relatively low stakes as well. It doesn't feel like a finale at all but more like a bad epilogue. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a finale than this and that movie is BAD. There isn't any build up to the final dinosaur battle as well. Apparently it was set up in the prologue that they released a year ago but they decided to cut it from the movie. They decide to cut the scene that shows the conflict between different species of dinosaur. Yeah great job guys. It doesn't help that this film is mindlessly boring as well and it doesn't deserve its 2 and a half hour runtime. This is a train wreck of a film that you shouldn't watch even if you like the original film. It's a waste of your money.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The new Jurassic World movie has got to be one of the worst big budget hollywood film I have seen in quite a while. The old returning actors are not enough to save the clunky dialogue or the absolutely pointless story here. As a conclusion to this trilogy, it fails in a majority of areas. Worst of all, in addition to being sloppily put together, is it's beyond derivitive. I honestly feel like I've seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other, much better films. Also, it has one of the worst villians I've seen put to screen. His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic. The special FX weren't even anything awesome, just more of the same. However, I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX, those were more impressive. I would recommend waiting for streaming, it wasn't even worth seeing on the IMAX as the majority of scenes were not worthy of the scale. 1/2 a dino out of 5.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The first half of the movie is a mishmash with too many characters and too many storylines to follow. I wanted a family movie, not a B-rated spy action with some dinosaurs on the back.<br/><br/>C. I. A. vs. Mercenaries vs. Other mercenaries who hire more mercenaries... My 7yo watched the motorcycle chase with zero interest and finally asked ""wait, who's chasing who again?"" My 14yo just gave up, and reached for her iphone.<br/><br/>Oh, and let's throw in some old characters into this mess. Because fan service. Cha-ching.<br/><br/>It gets better in the second half of the movie, where it all goes back to the ""nature + adventure"" format. But overall it's still a disaster.<br/><br/>P. S. Jeff Goldblum still rocks though.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Result of Poor writing . Only thing that satisfied me was action sequence before the interval , it really gave a seat edge experience , other than that whole movie was underwhelming . Script was too weak and lame . Except few places , film majorly missed the engaging factor . First half was slow and second half was predictable and boring . 2hrs 30mins was too long , literally tested my patience . Cast done their job . Technically visuals were good . Editing was inferior . Overall , unexpectedly a disastrous end to Jurassic saga . Watch at your own risk .</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Was it perfect? No. Was it fun? Absolutely! There will be a lot of things people will pick apart this movie for. I for one didn't mind it. It was a solid closing chapter to the Jurassic World trilogy. It was a nice balance with the newer stars and the OGs. A lot of ""hey, I know you from such and such"". When the casts get combined I was so happy. I love my OG Jurassic Park crew. They were my main reason for being excited and I wasn't disappointed in that regard. A lot of fun sequences really helped keep me entertained. It could've been a bit shorter but I'm still happy with what I got from it. Go in to have fun. It won't do you any good going in expecting a masterpiece. Plus it has a ton of baby dinosaurs, they were sooooo cute!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Mixed bag of greatness and mediocre. A really enjoyable blockbuster for what it is, has some poor dialogue in some scenes and a little cheesy bits with the boss of Bryson. The cast though is excellent, cinematography is amaze balls, and there's plenty of awesome high budgeted action sequences throughout. I loved a lot of it though I must say it's great fun especially in IMAX! There was even a great Q&amp;A I got to see was silly when someone said finally when that ended I was thinking why pay for the longer version with extras if you don't want to see that aspect some don't make sense. I crave any special feature I'd work on film if I could and I'd say Jurassic World: Dominion is a worth seeing.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This was terrible in every way. Bad acting, terrible script, bad CGI and stupid decisions (on and off the screen) cannot rely on nostalgia for a good film.<br/><br/>1. Ellie is not as stupid as the film makes her out to be, as one of the characters signposts the fact that he is a double agent and she apparently doesn't pick up on it.<br/><br/>2. Everyone seems to be phoning in their parts. They know the film will make money, so in their minds why bother I guess? The absolute worst culprit Campbell Scott who plays Dogson- I have no words. He's terrible and I can't tell if it's due to the script or he wasn't right for this part. It might be both. The original cast are awful- they don't seem enthusiastic to be there and I don't blame them.<br/><br/>3. The plot makes no sense. After lengthy exposition opening the film we dive headfirst into one bad and nonsensical decision after another. For example, despite knowing that everyone is looking for her Maisie goes into town, despite being told not to, sees a dinosaur at a construction site then comes back. What was the point of this?! And this is just in the first 10 minutes- there are plenty more. Also, Owen is catching Parasaurolophus with a lasso on a horse, despite the fact that if the dinosaur spooks for any reason it will drag both him and the horse along for the ride? He was dragged from the horse already- surely he's learned his lesson?<br/><br/>4. The callbacks to the original film take you out of the story. Instead of being subtle they practically scream ""notice me!""<br/><br/>5. The CGI is bad and doesn't blend well with the puppets they clearly used in some scenes. I applaud the fact that they are going back to puppetry, but it needs to be seamless with the CGI.<br/><br/>6. The script. Wow. Some of the lines are so cringeworthy I can't believe they made it into a Hollywood blockbuster. Just... wow.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and watch the original Jurassic Park- pretend this one and Fallen Kingdom don't exist.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Another generic Jurassic Park movie full of bad CGI.<br/><br/>Actors are good, but the CGI makes the movie look tame and unrealistic.<br/><br/>I wish they made the Jurassic Park movies like the first two movies. More practical effects as it looks more realistic (compare T-Rex or Velociraptors from the first movie with this... Its day and night.<br/><br/>This is just another cheap (maybe not the budget, but how it looks) generic, way to action-packed, child friendly movie like Hollywood is spamming out now'a'days.<br/><br/>I wish movie makers had the balls to take chances like they did back in the day when Hollywood was good.<br/><br/>Now they rely too much on CGI because its safe. But it makes the movies not have a realistic feeling to it.<br/><br/>I'd say I will give it a 3 star max, and thats solely because of the actors makes it watchable.<br/><br/>Without them, it would be a 1 star.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic park ""world"" Is garbage by definition.<br/><br/>Not even If I was a kid I would love this
Movie. The Jurassic franchise, just like every other popular franchise since the 80s 90s has become family friendly. The movies are made exclusively to cash-In. Not for art. Or the will to make a classic that can be enjoyed for years.<br/><br/>There's Not a single scary scene. The Cgi looks like crap, and are used all the wrong ways. But the main Issue Is that There's no exciting story to speak off. The Cgi May have evolved through the years but In Hollywood, storytelling Is zero.<br/><br/>All I can say Is, I hate this movie and It will be the last movie I see from this lousy director. He should helm some family anime instead of a sequel to one of the most beloved horror movies. Jurassic park was a masterpiece. And not a single director since the original has captured that.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is directed by ""Colin Trevorrow.<br/><br/>It stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Niell, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and DeWanda Wise.<br/><br/>The final film in the Jurassic franchise finds ""Owen"" and ""Claire"" looking after ""Maisie"" from the dinosaurs roaming the world. Meanwhile ""Alan Grant"" and ""Ellie Sattler"" infiltrate a secure facility that holds dinosaurs to uncover its dark secrets.<br/><br/>I love the first two ""Jurassic Park"" films. After that though these films go downhill. ""Fallen Kingdom"" left a sour taste in my mouth and It lowered my expectations for this film. It's no surprise this film was really bad.<br/><br/>The positives<br/><br/>All the acting is great. All the main actors have great chemistry and I love how the original cast bounce off each-other. When the two casts meet its funny and charming and it's when the movie starts to improve. The CGI on the dinosaurs look great and I appreciate that more animatronics were used. There was some good cinematography sometimes and the music was great as it is in all of these films.<br/><br/>The negatives<br/><br/>The plot and characters are atrocious in this film. There's 3 different plots going on and one isn't in the film for over an hour. The main plot is stupid and it doesn't focus on dinosaurs or human extinction. The characters get no development apart from two of them and even then Its not well developed. The dinosaur scenes are shoved in just to make a scene cool. The big dinosaur isn't introduced until the last 30 minutes and it just shows up out of nowhere. Some dinos are in the film for a minute and just leave without a trace. The editing is awful especially in the action scenes. It does the terrible ""shakey cam"" and quick cuts and it hurts your brain just watching them. The horror was non existent as I wasn't scared one bit in the film. There's pointless nostalgia just like the first two films that adds nothing to the story. Finally the green screen in the film is awful. You can see the outlines of actors when they're placed in from of them and it takes you out of the movie.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>While I don't think ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is the worst film in the franchise. It's still awful. It has great acting, good CGI and animatronics, nice cinematography and great music. But it's unfocused and messy plot, poor editing, useless dinosaurs, pointless nostalgia and atrocious green screen make this a terrible end to an extinct franchise.<br/><br/>I'm going to give ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" a:<br/><br/>3/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I watched this movie expecting it to be bad, but at least better than the fallen kingdom. I was wrong. This is even worse. It relies too much on nostalgia and callbacks to the original Jurassic Park, but it just fails. The storyline is a mess, the villain is wayyy boring, and the dinosaurs are just there because it's a Jurassic movie, nothing else. Kids may love it, but anyone expecting something more will be disappointed.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was so utterly predictable it was a little painful. Luckily the nostalgia nods were sprinkled throughout and mostly not forced. You can tell they tried to have some funny one-liners which fell flat a lot of the time. They need to take some notes from Marvel on those. The CGI and action was as good as you'd expect and offered favorable intensity. The story itself was somewhat lazy IMO. Did I mention it was totally predictable? I left the theater going...meh.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">After the last movie, which I totally didnt like, I was just hoping that the Jurassic Park saga had a decent end. And I actually got a pleasant surprise; the movie was actually quite good. The beginning of the movie can be a little tiring giving that the acting is definitely not the best thing in the movie, but you endure it because you can see dinosaurs in our society from the first second. And then the story at the beginning is actually kinda bad, now, we have another bad company trying to use dinosaurs for their evil plans just as in the other jurassic movies, and then we have even more exposition about how now the world works and etc, but fortunately the story manages to go in a more interesting direction for me. The plot with the lobsters was something that give a little change to the story, cause the way this company was exploiding the dinosaurs was much more believable that in other movies, where they only wanted to open parks and zoos. Later on, I like when we have the 2 main storylines, the lobster one and Chris Pratt rescuing her daughter, and the original character are following one while the other are following another, it gives all of them chances to breath and give them something to do. Then theres a really huge, big action scene that I loved, because that was exactly what I was expecting, dinosaurs in our society eating tons of people. After this the movie drops a little in quality because for some time, not a lot happends. And is just the 2 storylines working its way and mixing with one another. Still, this was entertaining enough to not be boring, and at at the end of the second act things got much more interesting; yes, we return to the same tiring jungle scenario but this time there are new dinosaurs that feel like a big threat, and are present until the end of the movie. We have big action scenes at the end, which I really liked and a big fight between dinosaurs which was also really cool. With that, the movie ended and it leaves me with a good enough experience. Practically most of the jokes dont land and are just weird to see this much comedy in a jurassic park movie but it never interrupts an important scene, so its fine, the story is a little messy but you can still follow it and enjoy it and despite being a little repetitive, you are still excited to see how this time the dinosaurs are gonna eat the ad guys.<br/><br/>It definately could have been much better, but it was still enjoyable, exciting and interesting enough to be worth the watch.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Most of this film is how can we hurt the dinosaurs or have them hurt each other. No character has growth, no positive development through the story. Last movie was kill all the dinosaurs in a volcano eruption and watch them die and this time, lets put them all in a sanctuary and then burn it down! Why the constant need to kill all the dinos? This crew should really be able to do better by this point. Very unimpressed.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I have seen this film about 15 times already... but not literally, I mean I've seen this exact film THROUGH watching other generic Hollywood puke.<br/><br/>Movie was was too long for the generic Hollywood safe formula, and regurgitated generic dialogue.<br/><br/>A hilarious example IMO without any real spoilers. Chris Pratt teamed up with someone later/midway through the film to get back together with his wife who was separated from him on the Dinosaur island or whatever. They give them a a tracker like it's a video game, ""here you can use this to find her location"". Chris Pratt basically just nods... other character then goes ""you really love her huh?""
what?... I've only heard this line sixty times in various films, however, it didn't really make much sense in the context and scene that it was placed in. It's like they just opened the generic Hollywood play by play handbook, ""ah yeah this is a good one, shove this line in there somewhere... you really love her huh?.. brilliant""
...Yeah he loves his wife so he's trying to save her... his love was already established for this woman. It's not a coming of age film where some kid has some undecided or secret feelings for someone that someone else has to notice and point out. It just was dumb generic lazy cliche writing that didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes were ok but obviously due to the rating of the movie could have been much more intense and satisfying if it were given a mature ratings.<br/><br/>If we are going to revamp the series, can we just go a different direction. Can we take a risk? Go full on borderline horror movie, make it rated R. I want to see some gore, All the intense scenes with the dinosaurs could actually have some impact and some bite (pun intended), giving that character's fear some real contextual depth through brutal consequence of getting caught by a predator much more formidable than ourselves. It could almost be reminisce of a movie like Alien or something.<br/><br/>Also I didn't have much of an opinion of Chris Prat before this movie, thought he was funny in parks and rec and I realize he lost weight and gained muscle and started taking on more serious roles. I will say for this film, He looked VERY satisfied with himself through his facial expressions in most scenes, It looked unnatural to me the way he was acting was like ""yea that was awesome, I looked really concerned there"". ""oh yea I'm having a heart to heart moment here with my wife or daughter""
I don't know.. I just didn't buy his acting at all. It wasn't terrible, but it was immersion breaking to me, essentially the third wall was knocked down and I saw him as an actor acting in his scenes as opposed to a character responding to things in the film.<br/><br/>I Enjoyed the chase scene for what it was, the black market scene was ok, the Ice scene was ok, and some of the raptor and giant dinosaur scenes were decent although I still think they would have been a lot more exciting with a more mature rating.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">There's a line, late in Jurassic World: Dominion, delivered by Jeff Goldblum. Caught between two ridiculous CGI dino titans, Ian Malcolm says, ""This isn't about us."" Our heroes realize they can just slink away unnoticed, and they do. The dinos keep stomping and snapping without them.<br/><br/>This line is more about the audience than the film. What Spielberg and Crichton created as a contemporary Frankenstein fable about HUMAN BEINGS and the dangers HUMAN BEINGS face when HUMAN BEINGS attempt to play God. Jurassic Park was about HUMAN reactions to dinosaurs: awe, wonder, dread, fear, terror.<br/><br/>And now, here we are, a film as close to Artificial Intelligence as anything you'll see. There's no warmth of humanity here. Humans don't act like human beings, not even characters we loved in 1993 - they all act like automatons, thrust forward from one meaningless action set piece to another. And the audience doesn't get to think like human beings (why are dinosaurs thriving globally, why can an insect fly after its wings have burned off, how can characters find other characters in seconds, despite miles of tunnels).<br/><br/>I hated JW and despised JW:FK. So why did I come to this one? I'm a human being. I loved JP, I liked JP:TLW, aI chuckled through JP3. I loved Malcolm, Sattler and Grant as characters. I love dinosaurs. As human being, I love the thought of seeing these majestic creatures alive. Times are hard for human beings, and I had hope for a good story to ease my mind and give me a thrill.<br/><br/>But Malcolm is right at the end of JW:D. This movie isn't about us. It's about grabbing cash, pulling nostalgia strings and throwing nonsense on the screen until it sticks. We can all slink away now - this monstrous trash will continue with or without us. Human beings with human hearts and human minds are no longer necessary.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the first of the JW trilogy that actually resembles the legendary brilliance of the original JP in certain forms. While it still does suffer from certain clichés and scattered random plot choices, it's definitely the most chaotic and entertaining since the original. The dinosaurs are more fearsome than ever and definitely make the ride that much more intriguing with cgi that is highly precise. The old and new cast blending works fairly well Though can be somewhat forced at times with the comic relief. The original actors definitely add that bit of fan service we all know would come along with them. I still don't think this trilogy was as good as it could've been it does close out in a very solid fashion.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The audience of the entire movie theater show on the opening weekend was favorable primarily to Jurassic Park: Dominion. Although for me, there were a few neat parts in the film, there were also too many rehashes from other Jurassic Park and Jurassic World films placed here.<br/><br/>In this particular theater, the audience was wide-ranged, from 5 to 80+. There was a melding of those fans of the Jurassic Park 3 films with actors Sam, Laura, and Jeff. Then, some were aware of the more recent 2 Jurassic World films with actors Chris and Bryce. And were interested in seeing them all together to deal with man and dinosaurs. This story didn't dive into that as it should, and I didn't like the locusts' tie-in. But the Biosyn connection could have been written much better in my observation but wasn't.<br/><br/>Also, I happened to be sitting in the row ahead of several parents who had brought their children. All these children, ages 6 to 8, were only there for the dinosaurs - not the story. Some parts of the 'story' were traumatic. (I do want to add as an aside, I did have to listen to one six-year-old boy behind me who at least 5 times kept sadly asking ask his dad if the ""dinosaur ate the bunny ."" (Come on, folks - don't bring your 6-8-year-old to films like this if you're not prepared to explain! This dad did not.)<br/><br/>The point is, depending on where in the series one lands, whether or not we will be entertained. Those who are fans and were there from Jurassic Park all the way through - get it. The general audience has seen this all before; that's true. Jurassic World: Dominion has more re-treads from the previous 5 films instead of offering something fresh and different, presenting a better send-off for the series. I recognized this, but it still had some entertainment value, just not enough. For example, I was entertained by Malta's 'underground' black market scene. As I watched, it seemed like it could have been developed more independently from all this.<br/><br/>On another note, another opportunity lost was the introduction of a Therizinosaurus which realistically arrived in the Cretaceous period and not the Jurassic. Maybe I was one of the only folks in the audience that could not easily bend that suspension of belief, and it made me wonder why they did it. It's not like there weren't other Jurassic period dinosaur they could have developed.<br/><br/>But if this was one of those sly introductions they introduced to bring the audience into the Cretaceous as a tie-in for the next trilogy, they missed the opportunity to explain. However, that's too much of a deep dive for most of the audience, and who'll care? I'm mentioning this as another opportunity among many lost through shoddy writing, plot holes, lousy editing, or COVID-19 production, eh, take your pick.<br/><br/>There was so much potential there, but it ended up choppy and rehashed. While I was happy to see every character from the Park and World get together for this last outing, they deserved well better send-off.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Today I watched Jurassic park world domination and it was violently terrible.<br/><br/>There was a cool chase scene with Bryce Dallas Howard, there were like 2 jokes that made me do a small giggle, maybe 1 or 2 scenes that I thought weren't terrible, and also I guess some of the dinosaurs don't look egregious.<br/><br/>Besides that, there's nothing, this movie sucks. This is an unnecessarily long and embarrassing cashgrab with bad set designs, mediocre cgi, bad sound design and editing, bad editing, terrible acting from otherwise good actors, forgettable soundtrack, clunky dialogue, unnecessary exposition, and more plot convenience than I have seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>Everyone sucks at acting in this movie holy moly. Chris Pratt sucks, Bryce Dallas Howard is atrocious, the child acting was wooden, all of the original actors for some reason cannot perform to save their lives barring Jeff goldblum who is just playing Jeff goldblum. Laura Dern was particularly bad and that's very peculiar because I haven't seen a bad performance from her yet, but wooo boy did she not try. Campbell Scott was also absolutely awful, but I did find a scene with him kinda funny when it was meant to be funny (good job Trevorrow!)... Everyone feels like they came here for a paycheck and that's it, they all don't care<br/><br/>The sound design was horrendous and choppy, the music was overbearing and forgettable, it doesn't even feel like the same essence of a Jurassic park soundtrack. The sound effects feel so clunky and don't feel like they're in the same realm of the film. It's all just so bad.<br/><br/>The writing is messy and disorganized with the structure being like it's own elaborate puzzle to figure out what the heck is going on. They throw in an extremely convenient plot armor on characters and there's not a single bit of tension, everything everybody wants is right there and it takes no real struggle for the characters to do anything.<br/><br/>Honestly, I really blame a lot of this on the director. I've seen these actors do well before and Trevorrow has yet to show me a single film that I would even call alright.. This film is horrendous. He wrote it and directed it, there's no reason it should be this incomprehensible and boring.<br/><br/>There is little life in this dead horse they keep trying to poke at, this movie sucks, there's very little to grab onto and I do not recommend in the slightest.<br/><br/>Low 3/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first Jurassic Park was a classic, this one is not even close.<br/><br/>The scriptwriting and directing were atrocious - how could they release such an unfinished product? It's painful to watch now that I've seen it all in person because there are some truly cringe worthy moments where you can't help but say ""wow...they really missed the mark"".<br/><br/>Can't believe I wasted three hours of my life watching this garbage. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, and the special effects were laughably bad.<br/><br/>2022 is shaping up to be a pretty terrible year for movies. This has got to be the worst one yet!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This franchise should have been extinct since 1997. The original cast is here for the paycheck. The new cast is laughable. The plot is... Does this movie even have one? The CGI looks fake as hell. It's boring! Nothing specially thrilling happens. There's no payoff. Rubbish.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">It's hard to describe the plot of this movie as there are two different stories in this movie and I will say that one is interesting and works while the other doesn't. The story that in my opinion works is the one with Owen and Claire and I wish the entire movie was spent on this story. While the other story really didn't need to be included and only existed to have the original trio back for this movie. I feel like the original trio still could've been included in this movie but just in a different way than what we got. I feel like due to these two different stories taking place is where the pacing for this movie takes a hit. I can safely say that I felt all 2 hours and twenty minutes of this movie because this movie moved at both a snail's pace and a fast one. One story moved at such a fast pace that it was hard to keep track of what exactly was going on while the other moved at such a snail's pace with barely anything interesting happening that I was hoping for a dinosaur to get loose so something would happen. Now I probably wouldn't have noticed this issue if the acting for this movie was good and well you can tell everybody was trying their best. Everybody in this movie you can tell is really trying to give it their all, especially the original trio, but it just came out flat. The only real standouts for me were the original trio consisting of Laura Dern, who plays Ellie Sattler, Sam Neill, who plays Alan Grant, and Jeff Goldblum, who plays Ian Malcolm. Honestly, the only good thing in this movie is the special effects. In the end, this was a very underwhelming finale for this already underwhelming series.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Why?<br/><br/>They had one easy job. One. Job. Dinosaurs in the human world. Those T. Rex scenes from The Lost World? Yeah, do that, but with a bunch of different dinosaurs in different parts of the world. That's it. The premise doesn't make much sense and the human-only parts of the story might as well be bad, but hey, at least we would have seen dinos doing their cool dino stuff in our world. You know, as it was advertised?<br/><br/>Instead, they wasted the budget that COULD have been spent on the CGI/writing necessary for this on actors from past JP movies and ads that looked more fun than the movie itself. As a result, we got this utter disappointment that is basically a generic sci-fi action movie with some dinosaurs here and there.<br/><br/>I just wish the people who approved all of this would realize that there is profit to be made for their greedy corporate hands by making fun movies that aren't 2 hours of false advertising and failed nostalgia bait. Alas, I will most likely get even more disappointed in the years to come.<br/><br/>I must give it 1 star, not because I want to, but because I feel it is my obligation as a JP fan since I was a small child.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">So, we finally get the 3rd &amp; final part in the Jurassic World Franchise after 4 years &amp; to be honest I was expecting something big. Sadly, this was a let down &amp; I on the rare occasion, agree with the critics with this one.<br/><br/>The film sees the dinosaurs now living &amp; hunting alongside humans all over the world, 4 years after the destruction of Isla Nublar. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.<br/><br/>I found the film to be at best average &amp; at worst blurred &amp; muddled. At 2 hours &amp; 16 minutes it drags &amp; drag with no real story as such to follow. What was the point of the story? I mean, I couldn't even tell people what this film was about without looking it up, it's that lack luster. The film could've been 20 minutes shorter, even 30 minutes for what it was.<br/><br/>The return of the older characters was good as with the action &amp; effects. Some eye-candy here &amp; there. But the story was somewhat non-existent &amp; the pacing was rubbish. Like I said, a good 15-20 minutes could've been exercised from this film to keep the consistency.<br/><br/>Overall, average. Not as good as Fallen Kingdom or even the first Jurassic World which I found to be generic, but good.<br/><br/>5/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">At 2 hours and 26 minutes, this marks the longest movie in the Jurassic series. May he Rest In Peace, but it's probably good that Michael Crichton wasn't alive to see this abomination of a film. The only reason I'm even giving an extra star is because the dinosaurs looked good and some of the cinematography was on point, but my god this was unbearable to watch.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this film is how predictable the story was and how shallow of a character its antagonist was. Nothing against Campbell Scott, I'm sure he's a swell guy, but watching him play this character was like watching a lifeless Dave Wallace from The Office. He had no depth, no angle, and every choice he made could be seen from 100 miles away.<br/><br/>Another reason I couldn't stand this movie was how many times Chris Pratt got everyone out of trouble by putting his hand up to the dinosaurs. I can't tell you how badly I wanted him to try it just to have one of them take a couple fingers off. It might've added some excitement to the movie.<br/><br/>I really wish I could keep going and tell you about how bad the whole thing was; but since I fell asleep for fifteen minutes of the movie, I guess it wouldn't be very honest of me to say I saw the entire thing. This is supposed to be the last movie of the series, so I was expecting some crazy things to be happening. I wanted to see dinosaurs fighting in the city, knocking into buildings, and stepping on cars. Instead, we were served a recycled plot with generic action and storytelling.<br/><br/>Give me a job, Universal, and I'll write a better script with my eyes closed. Or go outside your doors and find the nearest crackhead because I'd guarantee you 100% they could write a better movie, too.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first Jurassic Park remains my favorite movie of all time. The sense of awe and wonder seeing dinosaurs for the first time on the big screen was life changing for me, which left any follow up with impossible shoes to fill.<br/><br/>Out of all the sequels, I thought the first of the new World trilogy got many things right (&amp; some wrong) - but overall the second trilogy was off to a very promising start in my books. While Fallen Kingdom hit impossibly low standards, I chalked it off to teeing up for the ""last"" one.<br/><br/>I will try to be as objective as possible, and summarize the Dominion good and the bad:<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/><ul><li>A couple of scenes had really good tension to them (Claire's plane eject sequence was excellent, the white raptor motorcycle chase had little stakes to it but was well choreographed) - and I guess that was pretty much it in the entertainment department.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Seeing the original cast reunited brought an uncontrollable smile to my face. It's been a reunion that I've been craving for since watching The Lost World as a kid, and I'm glad I had the chance to see it happen in my lifetime.</li></ul><br/><br/>The bad (which is quite bad):<br/><br/><ul><li>Those tense scenes? Yeah, they weren't that tense at all because you know with absolute certainty that the characters are wearing armor with thicker padding than the movie's excessive runtime</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The runtime. Exceedingly long, and more than two thirds had no reference or had nothing to do with dinosaurs at all, even if they were somewhere in the background. Maybe the plot was just uninteresting and irrelevant for extended runs that the movie felt longer than it actually is.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I don't remember any of the new character names because they are inmemorable to the extreme and their presence serves no real purpose, regretfully most of which are good actors who are severely underutilized. I love Omar Sy as much as the next person, but I'm curious to know how someone can change their career path from a theme park/zoo keeper to the French Intelligence within a 4-year period (or whatever time had passed). Lastly, the last thing this franchise needs is cartoon villains and/or weaponized dinosaurs. Armies don't recruit tigers for a reason (because it's dumb). Second to last thing this franchise needs is good guy t-rexes and raptors. Please, please stop rehashing and ruining the earned finale of the original.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The original trio: as wonderful as it was to see them onscreen, I felt that their presence would've been more meaningful if they were, let's say, government consultants on how to contain the dinosaur outbreak with maybe one or two high-stake / life-threatening situations, if the actors are physically unable to run around for 2 hours anymore. What we got was super disrespectful to largely confine them to the locust subplot (or locust main plot; honestly at times I was unsure whether I was watching a monster movie, or a pest control movie). A common criticism directed at the Godzilla franchise is that the audience doesn't really care much about the human subplots, but I believe the the original JP trio have enough credit with the audience, who would have given them a lot of leeway to explore what they've been up to, their motives, and their relationships after all these years - literally if they were talking about anything else other than grasshoppers for the entire time they were onscreen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The locust plot: the people who thought of it, greenlit it, shot and edited it... all of them need to respectfully find jobs outside of the moviemaking business. A locust crop-threatening outbreak in Texas is the main threat of a Jurassic Park movie. Let that sink in.</li></ul><br/><br/>I don't want the franchise to die, I really don't - but I can't help but believe that everyone who grew up watching Jurassic Park could've easily come up with a better script for the sequel by the age of 8. I hope that somebody takes audience criticism with an open mind and go back to basics for the inevitable next one. Thank you.<br/><br/>(1 star for bringing back the OGs, 1 for the couple better scenes, 1 because this new trilogy is finally over and we can move on with a clean slate).</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Man is now competing with dinosaurs for the planet and the problem they have is ""illegal poaching."" Biosyn is a genetic company that has created a locust that destroys crops that are not made from their GMO seeds. It is run by a Steve Jobs looking guy (Campbell Scott). There is no introduction of characters. Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) the daughter/clone of Charlotte is kidnapped by Biosyn because of her DNA. Chris Pratt, talk to the hand raptor whisperer, who made me lose interest in the series, is at the rescue. And like a Marvel movie trying to kill Thanos, they bring back as many characters as possible or at least the shaving cream can. And of course the carnivore must be bigger and badder in every film and right now it is about the size of infinity minus one. It doesn't make it as scary as the first T-Rex or raptors. Boring. Jeff Goldblum is not dead and I was hoping they would cross him with insect DNA, even though that has been done. I will say this is the first major film I have seen in a long time that didn't have a gay or interracial couple.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went into the cinema with low expectations, but boy was I wrong. Firstly the women-washing and imposing of strong female characters in spite of a strong male lead role is just getting boring. After half of the movie went on, I paid specific attention to Chris Pratt's lines - which he almost didn't have any of. Its like they put him there to stare agreeably as the strong females did all the work. By the end of the movie he didn't even speak.<br/><br/>Secondly the script went into 5 different directions and tried to explore it from every angle which just turned out to be boring and mundane. The dinosaurs are everywhere, there is a girl clone, dinosaur-locust and impending famine, generic look-a-like of Tim-Cook as CEO of the biggest world company, underground dinosaur sales and fights, healing all diseases and ultimately Chris Pratt making promises to a dinosaur to bring back its baby.<br/><br/>Thirdly the characters made illogical decisions all across the movie. (SPOILERS COMING UP) For example by the end of the movie where all the characters got together by that outside hut / safety sanction or whatever it was called with the ladder - and they hear that the big bad dinosaur is coming - Chris Pratt says quote ""nobody move"". They wait for the dinosaur to come 5 feet away from them and then they turn around and run and hide behind a car?? Another example - when the fast shuttle with the girl is stopped on its way to the airport why do they decide to go deep into caves with crocodile-looking dinosaurs instead of following the tunnel that they know will lead them to safety? Third example - the chase in Malta with the raptors - the strong female managed to outrun the raptor during the roof chase, but later on the the raptors are seen to catch on and even outrun speeding cars.<br/><br/>I am giving it a 3 just because the visuals were satisfying, but I am not sure why I didn't leave the cinema after 90 minutes of boredom and spare myself 1 hour of a badly put together movie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I do praise Dominion for utilising the different species of dinosaurs to present the characters with unique threats. It kept the action diverse enough to not grow tiresome.<br/><br/>Also, with a cast this stacked, it goes without saying that the performers all give it their all and give some charisma that this script does not deserve.<br/><br/>This is where my positives end, because this has an incredibly dumb, contrived screenplay, much like other big films I've seen in recent blockbuster memory.<br/><br/>This third film does not feel like the conclusion to a trilogy, let alone a franchise. It exist just so that there can actually BE a trilogy. There is no attempt to provide payoff to anything that was established in previous films, or even in this film.<br/><br/>The opening sequence gives us a newscaster voiceover giving us a bunch of information we already knew, then we are subjected to over two hours of people running around either performing Macguffin fetch quests or fleeing from dinosaurs. Finally, we get another news voiceover at the end of the movie that wraps up all the conflict and loose ends with a nice pretty bow.<br/><br/>I feel sick for these actors, knowing that their talent was wasted on such thankless roles. None of them actually develop in any substantial way or even contribute to the plot. In fact, most of them don't even need to be in the movie.<br/><br/>Half the cast is only here for nostalgia porn, and the entire cast just plays the same role of ""person who runs around and occasionally spouts expository dialogue."" It's embarrassing. Even the villain is just ""evil Steve Jobs,"" another uninspired addition.<br/><br/>Lastly, this movie promoted itself on the concept of ""DINOSAURS ARE ON THE MAINLAND NOW!!!"" This was such a false advertising gimmick and I feel insulted.<br/><br/>We really never see any sort of consequences of dinosaurs being integrated into the world. 90% of the movie takes place on a corporate compound, and it's even more boring than the mansion in the last movie.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is a product; it banks on the popularity of its brand name and doesn't actually have any character, ideas, themes, or even set pieces that feel unique or even add up to make a story.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I hate it.<br/><br/>Shameless.</div>

The story was so convoluted. It was always tense and unease but no threat. It was bad dialogue by a grade actors.<br/><br/>The cgi was hit and miss. Some was absolutely spectacular. Others stood out like a saw thumb. And the ending...... It was lack luster.<br/><br/>Honestly wait for tv.</div>

There's ooh, there's ahh, there's running and screaming, plus a subplot involving some rapacious corporate rats and Henry Wu (yeah, he's still around to keep meddling in science he can't possibly control), but still not a story worth the padded running time.

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Spinosaurus is the largest carnivore then Giganotosaurus but despite the movie being wrong, this movie was weak in all aspects. Of course, I expected some wokeness in the film. Jeff Goldblum was the only reason I watched this. Only the first two Jurassic movies were good. 3, was ok but too short &amp; was the shortest of the series but it was cool to see Spinosaurus. 4 was mediocre &amp; should have ended there. 5 &amp; this one was trash.</div>

All the main characters (who didn't die on the first) from Jurrasic park meet the main characters from Jurassic world.<br/><br/>I think fans / viewers are expecting too much. I went to the cinema to see this without watching any trailers or watching any reviews beforehand, not knowing what to expect, and I left the cinema happy with what I saw.<br/><br/>People see a negative review and jump on the bandwagon, because they want to be liked by others, and don't want to stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>Decent movie.

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Why would you ruin a franchise like this. Lets make a dinosaur movie about locusts. Seriously who came up with this story and who in the world green lighted it.<br/><br/>This is a kidnap movie and a movie about locusts that can end the world which also has some dinosaurs here and there.<br/><br/>Imagine leaving the last movie at dinosaurs being in the world needing to integrate into the world. And then coming up with this movie.<br/><br/>And then lets talk about the superhuman unkillable cast. Always in some ridiculous scenario but somehow still come out a live and unscathed. Also the clone girls story was lame.<br/><br/>Really bad movie. And especially a really bad dinosaur movie. Too long and boring because not enough time on dinosaurs. I would rather of had a movie with just the bigger t-rex and the usual trying to beat/kill it before it kills everyone else. But noooo i got locusts attack with little bits of dinosaurs inbetween.<br/><br/>This movie also felt like it was two different movies, with one side doing a kidnap movie and the other trying to get info on locust.<br/><br/>Im so annoyed by this movie. Sorry about the rant.<br/><br/>To end the review ill use a quote from the movie. ""Seriously? You made a promise with a dinosaur?""</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Remember the scene with the Brachiosaurus in Jurassic Park? Remember the sense of wonder and excitement you felt? How about the horror and anxiety you felt when the Velociraptors were stalking the children in the kitchen? There is nothing like that in this corporate, bland piece of uninspired trash they call a movie. Somehow they managed to make dinosaurs uninteresting and boring, while completely squandering the talent of Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill and Laura Dern. It really is a remarkable feat. The film feels like it was designed by an AI. It is a vacuous, empty, soulless experience that absolutely defecates all over the legacy of Jurassic Park and why people loved it in the first place.<br/><br/>The writing is abysmal. Locusts and genetically modified children take center stage while the dinosaurs are reduced to flashy CGI showpieces that occasionally pop out to eat somebody or menacingly stalk the main characters before they are tamed by Chris Pratt's magic hands. The entire Malta scene was basically a Mission Impossible knockoff complete with some snazzy British villainess and a car chase. It felt so utterly out of place. Unfortunately once all the main characters get to Apple HQ... I mean Biosyn, the film gets even worse. The entire film feels weightless and empty. There are no stakes, the audience doesn't care about any of the two dimensional characters that are introduced and nothing feels earned. There is no sense of urgency or danger because the movie is too cowardly to kill anyone or put anyone in actual peril. Trevorrow then desperately tries to cram mindless nostalgia down your throat in an effort to mask his horrible film making and complete lack of originality.<br/><br/>Some of the dinosaur scenes are cool, but this film just feels like a celebration of mediocrity. The original cast are reduced to parodies of themselves while all the interesting and thought provoking ideas from the first film are thrown out the window in exchange for some mindless plot about GMOs and giant insect swarms. Jurassic Park was good because it was intelligent. It was thought provoking. The dinosaurs were shown sparingly, and the scenes with the human characters were equally as important and interesting. In comparison, Dominion is stupid, bland and unoriginal, and makes Jurassic World look like a masterpiece. And what a waste. The Jurassic World Series had so much potential and it was utterly squandered.<br/><br/>I can't even recommend this film as a 'turn off your brain and enjoy the special effects' kind of movie like Transformers or Fast and Furious. This movie is utterly uninteresting, and no amount of CGI dinosaurs can save it from being a total waste of your time and money. It is a Frankenstein Jurassic Park drained of all the magic, warmth and charm of the original. Skip it, and watch the dinosaur scenes on YouTube.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This has got to be the worst movie of the Jurrasic Park series, 1 star is mainly for the only 2 scenes (1 with Bryce underwater and the chase sequence in the city). The film never holds viewer's attention from get go. Plot is twisted and is NOT about dinosaurs at all. The original theme score is used only once or twice in the entire movie.<br/><br/>It was so boring that I literally dozed off for 5 min in the middle of the movie, this has never happened with me ever, especially when you are shelling out a mini fortune to watch it in LieMax.<br/><br/>Save yourself the trouble and watch it on OTT whenever that is.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the franchise but am deeply disappointed that such a great franchise came up with this disaster.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The trailer promised dinosaurs interacting with the human world and exploring those problems, but most of the film takes place in a jungle by itself once again. The trailer clearly showed a scene with a T-Rex in a drive in &amp; that was all I wanted to see... the scene isn't in the film. Somehow the film both tries too hard (with an overly complicated story) and doesn't try hard enough (failing to give any mystery to any of the dinosaurs, failing to be a horror movie once again like the original). The first few moment of the film just throws a huge sea dinosaur at your in a wide shot, nothing like the sense of fear or wonder Spielberg created, no tension or anticipation... just a big dinosaur thrown at you. Boring mood, boring camera coverage, characters are merely inconvenienced by their danger not in constant awe at how amazing the situation is. Characters regularly put themselves in danger, acting like superhero's instead of just people who get in sticky situations... which is what we come to see. Few characters do anything clever to escape their situation, mostly just end up accidentally getting out without much effort. Lots of the film is sidelined by a Bourne Identity rip off feel, having characters needlessly jumping on fancy roofs instead of just setting it in everyday settings. The bad guy is another rip off of Steve Jobs. All the bad guys are super cartoonish super villains for some reason. All the actors are trying &amp; most succeed in holding their own, but it just doesn't have any spirit, sense of wonder, horror or well coordinated scenarios. I'm done with this franchise. I'll always love the original, but I'm embarrassed for all involved with this film taking down the name and classic status of the original. I wish Spielberg had taken care of his legacy here instead of letting others rip it apart. Jurassic World had some good ideas, many from him, but it totally fell apart.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you´d ask them they surely would prefer extinction to this lame series.<br/><br/>Like in the last part the movie get´s strangled by morality of cloning humans and other problems the actors have with each other.<br/><br/>The promise the last trash heap left us with (letting run the dinos free into the world) is done with a two minutes news reel, after this, they don´t matter so much anymore, except some James Bond hunt in Malta, which is imo the best part of the action at least.<br/><br/>The story, this terrible construct they involve now not only the new actors of JW but also the old ones, which is nice to see them again at first, but soon they get dragged under, into the mud which is the JW movies too. This story leads all of the actors now - once again - into some dino lair, constructed by some Biotech Steve Jobs caricature. He is another milestone of dumb and in fact pointless characters, which bumble around, trying to get the moralistic message of the movie makers across. The problem is that no one really cares... not the actors, not the viewers and surely not the dinos.<br/><br/>So when the viewer has after very long and boring 150 minutes made it to the end of this monstrous movie, he can only hope that the whole franchise goes the way of the dino.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Epic finale for the Jurassic Park franchise! Everyone has their opportunity to shine in this romp of a movie. Couple characters from the last movie fell by the wayside which is understandable given the triumphant return of the original cast. Viceral action sequences. The cgi was great. Loved the scale of this movie as everything comes full circle. I really enjoyed it.</div>

<a class=""title"" href=""/review/rw8229064/?ref_=tt_urv""> A wonderful self aware performance by Jeff Goldblum and a star making turn by DeWanda Wise are literally the only things holding this bloated mess of a Jurassic film up.

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Tired, bloated and overlong supposedly final film in the Jurassic series (Yea right) finds the legacy characters from Jurassic Park crossing paths with the Jurassic World characters in a film that makes its first major mistake by not only not paring them up sooner (They only meet in the last twenty minutes of the film) but have them run separate and equally dumb storylines that really has nothing to do with dinosaurs or what this film was advertised to do. (Planet of the dinosaurs anyone?) . Of the pair of storylines running in this movie, the mutant locus one, (while it has nothing to do with dinosaurs at all) is the better of the two and the reason why because despite it being still dumb and having nothing to with dinosaurs, it's actually more interesting and better acted. The Jurassic Park characters which includes a rejuvenated and game Sam Neill (who redeems his terrible performance from Jurassic Park 3 ) Laura Dern (Who was barley in Jurassic Park 3, thank god) and a top of his game Jeff Goldblum ( who was in this franchise's only fairly good sequel ""The Lost World"" and mercifully only had few minutes of screen times in its second worst sequel ""Fallen Kingdom"") all try their best with the hooky yet brainless material they are working with and for the most part they succeed. Both Sam Neill and Laura Dern pick up seamlessly their natural chemistry from the original Jurassic Park and it's sweet and compelling while Jeff Goldblum naturally picks up Ian Malcolm's sense of self righteous bitting wit and disarming charm. While the script has some of the worst dialogue all three actors have had to work with, only Goldblum manages to turn the tables on the terrible screenplay he was had to work with some quick witted improvisation that gotten the biggest laughs in the entire movie which has him almost breaking what they call the 4th wall and making fun of most of things that are happening in this film, which is a god sent because Jeff is really telling the audience that he knows this movies sinks and he understands what the audience is going through. A brilliant master stroke that only a great actor like Goldblum can pull off undetected from the director and producers of a film they are working on that they think stinks.<br/><br/>The second of the storylines while more action oriented, is not only more dimwitted but lacks focus and is barely even acted at all. It's a continuation of the plot threads that was left over from the last movie and it's tries to recon certain revelations but still ends up worthless and uninspired. Chris Pratt phones in his performance and you can sense he knows this film is not very good. Bryce Dallas Howard tried her best but her character still is as underdeveloped as ever and the only actor who comes out of this storyline with her head high is Dewanda Wise, manages to not only steal the spotlight from Pratt and Howard but her character manages to be a hell of a lot more interesting . Unfortunately, not even her great acting talent can overcome the terrible script that does no one any favors and rips off several action sequences from ""The Borne Ultimatum"" which involves a roof top and motorcycle chase in a foreign city. In this film, those rip off sequences added raptors and James Bond bad guys to chase our heroes in the city of ""Malta"" and even with those added elements, they lacked the kinetic energy and intensity that ""Borne"" movie had in spades.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie while better than the brain dead ""Fallen Kingdom"", it's still a bloated mess. And despite the game efforts by the returning Jurassic Park cast (Especially a great self aware performance by Jeff Goldblum) and a scene stealing, star making turn by Dewanda Wise, it's probably time to end this franchise before they turn out a movie that is ""Jurassic Park 3"" bad.</div>

Not a boomer ( with WTF lines like ""he slid into my Dm's"") / angsty teen / generic action hero characters that run around like headless chickens but always miraculously surviving. If you pump the movie so full of ""main"" characters and let the whole group run around deadly Dino's and nobody dies it's no surprise the movie is more boring than watching hairs grow in an armpit.</div>

You can definitely tell Hollywood to cramming all these female actors down our throats. FINE! But THIS movie started Chris Pratt I'm expecting to see mostly Chris Pratt! Ugh! Show up an hr into the movie and you'll be fine. It was more of a mini series crammed into 2.5hrs, and it didn't work. Should have kept the focus on the main character and his relationship with Blue and her baby. If you have nothing else to watch and it's really hot where you live right now AND you need a good nap, go see it. 🤷</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">5 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion is an awesome science fiction action film that ends the series in a high note. And takes the Jurassic Park film which it never has been there before. Feeling different from the previous films. Which some may enjoy or some will miss the nostalgia of being back in the island with dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The plot follows with people trying to coexist with dinosaurs. Some are amazed by the creatures living among them. While others are breeding and using them for an evil agenda. The plot follows Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who are living in hiding and trying to keep Maise (Isabella Sermon) safe. After the previous film and discovering her secret. While Ellie (Laura Dern) discovers prehistoric locusts that are destroying the farm fields and can be leading to our extinction. Which she enlists Alan (Sam Neill) and Ian (Jeff Goldblum) to help out and find out who is behind that. Which are the same people that Owen and Claire are looking for after they kidnap The raptor Blues baby.<br/><br/>The plot has a couple of storylines that intercept and feels different than previous films. Which makes it feel like a globe trotting action thriller as Claire and Owen come across hybrid mixed raptors that are weaponized to attack certain people. Leading to a motorcycle chase scene in Malta.<br/><br/>The action sequences are awesome. The visual effects are great. The cast ensemble is great. Its nice to see the original trio Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum back in action. I also love they brought one original character from the first movie back into the mix as a villain in this film. If your a fan of the series when the name is popped up. You will easily recognize. The film music score is also great.<br/><br/>For a long running time with the movie. It does feel fast moving and short with the movie running into one action set piece to another. Overall, the film is one fun big blockbuster thats best to see on the big screen.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">When I first saw the trailer I called it. This movie is incomprehensible. Where is the Dr. Hammond Prequel? It's gotten so cartoonish. Seriously, we are supposed to suspend everything we have seen in the first two films (Based on the REAL books) and believe that a Velociraptor, who has it's baby snatched away,goes back and seeks the help of humans to get the baby back? If humans and Dino's actually lived in the same era human's would be extinct in a minute. My head hurts from the fact that all these millions were wasted when we have so many horrible things that need fixing in this country.</div>

If I had watched this movie at the age at which I saw the original, I would have left the theater in tears. They don't know what to do with these stories anymore. There are some nice moments in this, but it never adds up as a whole. When everyone finally gets together, nothing happens! It's as if they were just casually gathering to take a selfie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just read this artice ""What Hollywood Needs to Learn from the Creative Disappointment of Jurassic World: Dominion"" and this sentence makes me laugh: ""While the film earned nearly $150 million at the domestic box office this weekend, reviews weren't kind and the film currently sits at a dismal 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes (the lowest of any film in this trilogy or the previous one).""<br/><br/>It's an artice that bemoans that Crimes of the Future discusses ""difficult questions about what happens when humankind exploits technology to change the natural course of evolution"" while this Jurassic Park sequel -- the sixth -- "" is a mess of ridiculous plot twists and cheeky fan service with an overabundance of monster movie CGI.""<br/><br/>I don't want to be one of those people that says, ""What did you expect?"" but the original Jurassic Park was a soulless piece of moviemaking livened up with great effects and it really has been all downhill from there, other than, you know, that time a dinosaur was on an airplane.<br/><br/>That article also says, ""Dominion frustrates because it arrives at a moment when the global film industry needs every type of movie that contributes to the broader ecosystem to thrive,"" and I have no idea what they're going on about. Of course this movie doesn't have the themes and nuances that you expect from a movie. It's a rollercoaster summer blockbuster, but Chauncer.<br/><br/>So yes, the sixth movie does everything it can to bring together everyone from the past: Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) with everyone from now: Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and their adoped daughter Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon). It even has the Barbasol can that Dennis Nedry used to sneak out dinosaur embyros way back all those years ago. It also has BD Wong in it and nothing his character Dr. Henry Wu touches ever works out.<br/><br/>So while the last movie -- Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom -- ended promising us a Dinosaurs Attack! World of humans trying to co-exist in a world were dinosaurs are suddenly everywhere, now horses and dinos live in perfect symbiosis and happiness within the space of a few years. The real problem? BioSyn leader Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) wants the world to only eat his crops, so he's made gigantic locusts that get out of control. I mean, Locust World is not a title that will get summer audiences, so maybe this is a backdoor pilot for a locust TV series.<br/><br/>There are also two new charactets, whistleblower Ramsay Cole (Mamoudou Athie) and rogue pilot who gets redeemed Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise). They both have just about the same journey to make as those on the side of wrong that find their way to helping our heroes.<br/><br/>Honestly, just like how as a kid I was only into kaiju movies for the kaiju, I'm only here for the dinosaurs. It takes two hours -- TWO HOURS! -- until to get to the island and unleash dinosaurs on humans. That's also my other problem: why would they build another island? Every single time they build an island of dinosaurs -- and BD Wong is involved -- it goes bad. Fool me once, fool me four times...<br/><br/>Actually, I want a whole movie about that Mos EIsey dinosaur flea market. People have baby tricereotops in cardboard boxes like puppies at Trader Jacks and other dudes are just eating dinosaur meat on a stick like we didn't have a whole wet markets thing that destroyed the world. And where did Soyona Santos (Dichen Lachman) disappear to at the end of that scene? She's set up to be a major villain and then...nothing.<br/><br/>Look, if anything, filmmakers should learn from the adut video industry and forego the story and just give audiences what they want: non-stop dinosaurs spitting in people's faces, smashing them into liquid and eating them while they try to ride on Segways. Give us a Jackass style blast of non-stop human decimation if you're not going to put together a great story. No story -- the anti-story -- will save us!<br/><br/>This is the third of the series that Colin Trevorrow has co-written (this time with Emily Carmichael, who also wrote Pacific Rim: Uprising). That article I mentioned up above bemoaned the fact that he hasn't made another movie like Safety Not Guaranteed and has been swallowed by the big film machine. Well, yeah. Some people like to make money instead of good movies. Well, after his Star Wars experience, he came back to direct this one and it's fine. There's some good moments of fright in the tunnels that connect the new part and everyone gets a laughable line and Sam Neil does that silly train a raptor pose and I thought, ""Man, you were in Possession, Sam Neil! How does one get from a movie where you're cucked by a demonic alien baby to the biggest movie of the summer? Again?!?""<br/><br/>If you don't have air conditioning, this movie will get you out of the heat for 2 hours and 33 minutes. Put my review on the poster, Hollywood!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Jurassic franchise has produced fantastic movies with stories that involved depth and character, until Dominion. This movie was terrible and disappointing.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes of the movie was slow and dry. All that time to find out that the premise of the movie was not about the dinosaurs. The movie was about the genetically engineered locus bugs which looked like a giant grasshopper the size of two footballs lengthwise. It was really annoying that this movie took such a terrible turn.<br/><br/>Then Blue's baby Beta (the velociraptor) was taken by contract poachers. Okay things temporarily became interesting. But then Blue had zero screen time in the actions taken to retrieve Beta. Nothing was done with Beta so adding that to the movie's story had no value.<br/><br/>The movie kept on introducing new dinosaurs that we have not seen on screen before, and that was as far as it went. Honestly, I would not consider Dominion as a Jurassic movie. It was more like a terrible science movie that happed to have a dinosaur here or there in the background.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This felt like it was written by a 15 year old kid. The cheesiest tropes, and dialogue that is cringy and unrealistic. And science from the imagination of an uneducated preteen. And THEN you have a cast that was careful to include all the current work requirements. Most of the cast were definitely NOT brought in on their merits, but to satisfy Hollywood's deep, hypocritical need to virtue signal. And the characters, oh my. Combine clichés, cheese, and desperate wokeness, and this is what you get.<br/><br/>I don't nit-pick about science or plot in action films, normally, but this thing is just so bad it almost makes me angry. Even the physics of motion with the visual effects was silly and cartoonish.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I just can't recommend this to anyone but the hardest-core Jurassic fans. It's just lame and silly.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I remember watching Jurassic park original. The sense of Wonder and thrill, slight horror and just overall the movie has stood the test of time. Sequels like the lost world I had a special connection too overtime and always loved, JP3 although being that movie I grew up with as a kid I knew was terrible but I did enjoy it as a kid. Growing up seeing Jurassic world come into play, it was a solid movie with a sequel following it not being such the best movie either... but when they announced they were going to release a conclusion to this new trilogy bringing back the old cast I was excited. And here it is. Jurassic World Dominion... and this movie is probably the worst Jurassic park installment ever made<br/><br/>Jurassic park 3 was better, this movie is Terrible in a lot of directions. Not even the old cast can hold the movie, it's nice to see them in the flesh, it gave me that nostalgia feel but the purpose and story surrounding it goes nowhere. Everything that leads up to terms just happens, there's a slight twist in the movie that was nice, but just doesn't feel earned. Everything in the movie doesn't feel earned and I think that's the main problem with it. The movie just feels like it's trying to be any other bland action block buster but throwing dinosaurs in the mix... I hate to compare this to the original, but what made the original so amazing was it combined the horrors of a disaster going wrong within the action.:. The sequels have been doing it ever since as well... even the bad sequels have been using the disaster method... part 2 with dinosaurs being brought to the USA, then 3 being stuck on an island, then the remake taking things from part 1... etc etc, I understand there's only so much you can do to leach off the same storyline... and for this new one I do appreciate the new direction... but this idea that dinosaurs are just a 2nd thought of danger throughout the movie just makes me not as thrilled as I should be... the dinosaurs in the movie just feel like an afterthought or product placement for the action itself, there's no tension, there's a couple of moments that I do feel the tension but overall it's just not there....and if you're gonna sit here and say ""they're dinosaurs you're not supposed to take this seriously"" A good example of a movie trilogy that makes you feel the stakes at hand was Matt Reeves planet of the apes trilogy you have this planet being controlled by apes, you feel the intensity arising, you feel it all, from the tone of the film and all now sure, these are dinosaurs compared to cgi apes who are like humans, but this idea of the franchise just going full cheese is just way too pathetic, it goes overboard in this movie... I feel like I'm watching a Jurassic park fan made movie, a bunch of characters don't care about the stakes and drop terrible one liners here and there, and a lot of characters are underutilized, There's maybe about 1 or 2 moments from certain characters and it's not they they are doing a bad job, the acting is fine, but the plot and story around the entire movie just feels like a entire drag, I didn't have my sense of urgency.... one thing for sure this movie highlights that I took away from was how much power the palm of your hand can do... I mean it just does so much in this film, stops characters from dying from predators that, let's be realistic here, would kill them... but I'll take it, Owen was a trainer of raptors and I guess the technique works, not just with him but kids and newcomers alike! So power to the hand! ... action is fine I guess... but again, It just goes back to my point that it just doesn't feel earned, not even the slightest... none of it does, the entire story of a missing Dino and child just feels totally not earned. When the scene came to play into motion I was thinking to myself ""this is really where this movie is headed?"" I guess I just could care less about this plot narrative.<br/><br/>The original characters also feel like a forced collision, it just feels like parts and components spread apart with characters meshed together and it's forced to work because the movie says it has to... it just doesn't lead up to anything that feels like it was meant to be earned. And then the characters from the OG surprisingly just feel way out of place in this movie, there's not enough to nibble on with grant and Sadler, they have their moments but that's just because their acting is amazing but the writing is horrendous not enough meat and potatoes for them, they have a very awkward moment towards then end that TOTALLY goes unearned in this movie. Ian Malcom tries his best to save the movie, which is what he is good at, but even he can't when the director allows almost every line he says to be almost 4th wall breaking it becomes annoying. It's almost like he's winking at the Audience 24/7 WE GET IT!!!<br/><br/>Best way to compare this movie... it's like eating breakfast mixed with dinner... not bad on paper, and might actually be good... but when you begin to eat it you realize it's not only a odd combination of foods but the food is stale, expired and terrible all together, some burnt others undercooked... things are just awful... oh but you have a nice cup of orange juice action... and on the side with a nostalgia action figure toy that comes included...<br/><br/>The EXECUTION of this movie leads to EXTINCTION of this franchise as we know it.<br/><br/>I hope nobody wastes money on this, only way you can actually enjoy this movie is if you're just on your phone and notice action is about to start so you put it down and watch away... and maybe a few scenes with characters you remember based on nostalgia other than that the sum of its parts is so bland and unoriginal. I feel you can genuinely make a better direction of plot... the events leading up to them finally meeting each other isn't even earned.<br/><br/>Pros: Action, Actors, nostalgia, effects, (I also appreciate the use of animatronics they were nice) music was okay I guess especially when they used some from the original,<br/><br/>Cons: too long, plot, story structure, script, execution,<br/><br/>P. S I enjoyed Jurassic world, didn't hate fallen kingdom, I did believed it was a slight step down though... but this one?!!! This is going down a step even further.<br/><br/>JURRASIC WORLD UNIVERSE RATINGS<br/><br/>Jurassic Park 9/10

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Written 36 hours after seeing the movie. Firstly, the criticisms: some of the actors feel like they're not really giving it their all. In the early stages of the movie, Isabella Sermon and, shockingly, Sam Neill are particularly underwhelming. Secondly, the ill-conceived notion of a romantic relationship between Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler is a complete disaster. There is no sexual chemistry between the characters and trying to fabricate it is probably the cause of Neill's awkward and stilted performance. Finally, and this is a strange complaint; there are too many dinosaurs in this movie. Almost every action sequence has a different creature feature and they start to blur. I'd start by cutting the pyroraptor, the dimetrodons and the therazinosaurus and see how that looks. The baby ceratopsian puppets are rubbery and unconvincing.<br/><br/>The plus points: this movie is a lot of fun and the Maltese scenes in particular are excellent. Every single character has a well planned conclusion to his or her arc, especially Henry Wu's redemption. There are multiple small references to previous movies and they're all really entertaining. I'm sure I'll pick up on a few more when I see it again.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This short line uttered by Alan Grant presaged that epic alpha v alpha bust up between the Giganotosaurus and the Tyrannosaurus Rex. It came at the climax of this fantastic movie, bookending the Jurassic Park saga that started 30 years ago. What a phenomenal summer blockbuster bonanza this has been for people of my demographic! First, we were brought back to our need for speed, and now, within weeks, we were being brought back to the magic of our love for dinosaurs. Having Sam Neil, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum coming together for this (possible) one last outing was an excellent peach of a decision by the production team. This movie captured exactly the sense of wonder, thrill, excitement and adrenaline rush many of us experienced back in 1993, and it also gave today's audience what they wanted, ie, that big feast of dinosaurs from different historical timelines and geography coming together. It even managed to bring a nod to the original in a crucial scene at the end, where, just like in 1993, the greedy bad guy tried to escape with a container of dinosaur DNA, got stuck, tried to get away, but eventually was confronted and killed by a group of Dilophosaurus. That is the charm of this movie, and I was still trying to catch my breath when the credits were rolling.<br/><br/>This is going to be a movie summer many will remember!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is unrealistic too drawn out the plot is lousy and seems non existent. It just has scenes that are action packed yet unsatisfying. The timing makes it more absurd. The lines are so vapid. The stars featured do not distract me from how bad it is.<br/><br/>The most original things are little noticable things that still do not make it worthwhile such as a flying motorcycle and people sneaking into a prohibited area. It is sickening. I am glad that I was treated to this garbage but disheartened that I had to sit through it. I recommend skipping it!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The worst of the 3 reboots, I'm relieved this is (hopefully) the last one. Why even bother with human actors? Just CGI the whole thing.<br/><br/>It's like the movie forgets what it's doing: it's one film in the beginning, a Roger Moore James Bond from the 70s in the middle, and Dante's Peak (or something) at the end. Glad Jeff Goldblum has some hilarious one-liners at least, he saved the movie from being 1/10.<br/><br/>JP producers -- please, no more!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Personally My Rating Is : 6.5/10<br/><br/>Just Watch it yesterday and it was quite fun movie. I love visual effect CGI Dinosaurs they make it super gorgeous but some of the Dinosaurs looks like a robot, kinda remind me of Star Wars monster. I love the cinematography looks super great and make the visual of the movie more beautiful, the story umm.. at the beginning of the movie the plot story was kinda weird but going to ending the story was getting better and better, some of the acting was like overacting? Idk it just look like not natural, and the pace to sometimes fine sometimes no. But ya this movie is still fun to watch.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Dont waste your money...wait for the free stream.<br/><br/>Absolutely lifeless! I cant believe Colin Trevorrow directed this.<br/><br/>Nearly 30 years has passed and Steven Spielbergs Jurassic Park is still putting Trevorrows 2022 sfx/vfx to shame. As for the story/script, it was just not thought out with subpar acting from nearly the whole cast. Production felt worse than the previous Jurassics.<br/><br/>I guess thats one way to burn a franchise to the ground.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's milking the cow time, it's simple as that. Jurassic World Dominion is not a candidate for the worst movie ever award but also nothing really good - it's like watching the same old story but with a slightly change of clothing again and again and again. In short: generic, redundant, a ""blockbuster"" like a zillion others made in the past decade. The special effect department did solid, that's the best part of the whole affair. Recommended only to the ultra hardcore lover of the empire of dinosaurs.</div>

The movie easily tops the rest of the movies besides the first and even then sometimes surpassed it. If you like dinosaurs, intense action, funny moments, and a great cast you'll definitely enjoy this.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION had one job. Show off how living with dinosaurs would effect the lives of the people. It was promised by the trailers/marketing and the ending of FALLEN KINGDOM. It hardly touches on that.<br/><br/>It's about locusts...LOCUSTS...I just scratched my head not once, not twice, but like three or four times. It's mind boggling to me that anyone involved in the film would think that would be the best focal plot point as opposed to dinosaurs out and about. I'm looking at Colin Trevorrow, Emily Carmichael and Derek Connelly who were directly involved with story and script.<br/><br/>Plot involving Pratt and Howard's characters involve the cloned granddaughter from the previous film being kidnapped by Biosyn who is owned and operated by Lewis Dodgson. Dodgson some how failed upwards as a John Hammond 2.0 and comes off as a paper-thin character/villain. Pratt and Howard are really just pawns to be moved throughout the story really. They've never been compelling characters in all honesty so there's nothing new there. Also the JURASSIC WORLD's mascot raptor Blue has hardly anything to do here. She has a baby raptor that gets kidnapped along with the cloned granddaughter and nothing comes of it.<br/><br/>In conjunction with what Pratt and Howard are going through, the original trio Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum have meaty roles, but their part in the story involves the unnecessary locusts. It's only till the end both sides meet up and find their way out of Biosyn HQ. Biosyn was only there to once again put the dinosaurs in a controlled environment.<br/><br/>I'm been very vocal on how I'm not a fan of the JURASSIC WORLD films, and the only reason why I had any interest in seeing this film was simply because Grant, Sattler and Malcolm returned on the promise that they would have roles more significant than a cameo. At the very least the movie delivers on that. The legacy characters are treated with respect and have something to do as opposed to just being in the film for the sake of being in the film. The unfortunate part is again, they mingled with locusts more than they mingled with dinosaurs.<br/><br/>DeWanda Wise as smuggler pilot Kayla Watts I found to be kinda cool. She had more charisma and personality than Pratt or Howard had in all three films combined.<br/><br/>It's baffling to me how FALLEN KINGDOM destroyed the island, and how Universal and the filmmakers were too afraid to show us actual coexistence with dinosaurs in real life situations. Just unacceptable.<br/><br/>All this film has going for is that the legacy characters are handled properly despite a terrible plot thread, and aside from that, some good dinosaur scenes, that's really all there is to it. Six JURASSIC films in and only one good one. Even if this is billed as the ""culmination"" of the films, pretty sure they'll make more if it prints money at the box office. Either way for me at least, the franchise has ran its course.<br/><br/>5/10.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the most disappointing and lamest sequel ever. Even JP3 is better than this. In few words this movie is combination of too much action packed into short running time, with too many characters and logical problems.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs were not the main point of this movie. Story mostly revolves around humans, bugs, and evil company. Dinosaurs are there only for ""decoration"" or marketing purpose. This is what makes it not a good jurassic park film. Should have named it jurassic locusts.<br/><br/>Characters have a very bad writing. Even the original trio from jurassic park 1. It's good to see the old actors from original, it was nostalgic. But it's a bad film if it purely depends on nostalgia.<br/><br/>The problem of having too many protagonists. 2 plot runs at the same time which makes this film hard to follow.<br/><br/>Cloned girl is typical pesky obnoxious rebel teenager who has some problems because she is a teenager. Also while riding her bike, she sees a very obviously evil person standing across the bridge from her but decides to go halfway into the bridge anyways so she can get ambushed.<br/><br/>Pilot woman decides to help some strangers because she saw some girl. Doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>In underground black market in africa, bunch of dinosaurs gets released free. But instead of running away, people didn't even care and watched the fight between Chris Pratt and random generic bad guy.<br/><br/>Carnivore dinosaur eats the bad guy but doesn't attack Own Grady, who is sitting right next to it. Is Chris Pratt immune to dino attack or something?<br/><br/>People don't shoot raptors and runs away. Also makes no sense.<br/><br/>Raptor was not able to catch up the woman - in the next scene the same raptor is running fast as a car.<br/><br/>Laser pointing raptors - another lame dumb idea borrowed from Fallen Kingdom.<br/><br/>Unnecessary side characters - evil lady gaga's discount woman, pilot woman with cringy personality, the dodgson's assistant guy with no development.<br/><br/>Primary villain - Dodgson! We got a dodgson here? See? Nobody cares. This is because he was a very boring bland villain with no any real motivation, no goals. What did he want? Become the monopoly of the food industry? What was the point of dinosaurs?<br/><br/>Instead of attacking immediately, Dinosaurs stalk people slowly like a ghost in a horror movie.<br/><br/>People wait for the dinosaurs to come instead of running away.<br/><br/>Giganotosaurus doesn't see the humans hiding behind car RIGHT IN FRONT OF ITS EYES. And gigano patiently waits for humans to escape to the building and decides to eat them at the very last moment. Gigano appears in this only to be killed by T-rex in the end. Because it's a jurassic park movie, and therefore it needs at least one epic battle scene of dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Dilophosaurs spawn in the tunnel from nowhere because the bad guy needs to die.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs and modern animals cannot coexist. Because dinosaurs will change the ecosystem.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I didn't much like ""Fallen Kingdom"". I thought that it replayed the various facets of the series that we'd seen before, just in a remixed fashion. I did say that I though that the ending might tease a possibility of something a bit different for the next film. It did, a bit, and whilst I wouldn't say Dominion was a good film, I don't think it's as bad as the last one, or as the critics have generally suggested.<br/><br/>With the technology of dino genes now in the hands of Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) and his company Biosyn, the world has come to an uneasy alliance with the escaped dinosaurs now forming part of everyday life. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is investigating a swarm of giant locusts, that are threatening the very ecostructure of the planet and believes that Biosyn are involved. She convinces Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to join her on a visit. Biosyn have never stopped looking for Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) and when one of their spies kidnaps her, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) undertake a rescue mission.<br/><br/>I mean, just to reiterate, I didn't think that this was great - but I went in with expectations so low that when it turned out to be alright I was pleasantly surprised. The dinosaurs in unusual environment sections are interesting, particularly the scenes in Malta. Towards the end we settle back into more familiar environment, a ""lost world"" jungle setting and science labs. I thought the integration of the two-story strands was OK, and it was nice - if not particularly thrilling - to see the old cast and new interacting. The look of the film is good, with nice camera work and CGI creatures.<br/><br/>There are aspects that I didn't like, particularly from the ending, without spoilers when the Dinosaurs of different species teamed up in the finale of ""Jurassic World"" I thought it was a bit stilly - and I still think that now. I felt it was a bit disappointing when, given the freedom of the whole world, to go to a laboratory near a remote jungle. It's another organisation that thinks they can control nature but whose shiny facility is quickly torn to bits when things go wrong. I also cannot make myself care about the clone human storyline, sorry.<br/><br/>Again, I don't think it's bad - just a bit too much stuff that you've seen before.</div>

1. Bryce Dallas Howard - wow is she beautiful and talented.<br/><br/>2. The original cast - I've really missed them.<br/><br/>3. Some scientific/philosophical debate - This was something that I LOVED about the first movie. Hearing scientists debate the ethics of it all. I'm glad they brought it back a bit.<br/><br/>Negatives:
1. A plot - It was lackluster and unclear.<br/><br/>2. Chris Pratt - Seemed like his heart wasn't really in this one.<br/><br/>3. The setting - Jurassic movies work well in tropical environments. I wasn't feeling the snowy settings.<br/><br/>4. The lack of an overarching storyline - We've been waiting for sequel material to come from that Barbasol can for 30 years. But it didn't feel like this was the plan all along. It's like they pulled a Rise of the Skywalker. They got scarred because the plot lines they had used in the previous movies didn't really work, so they pulled in something from 5 movies ago to try and provide a big ending. It ended up just kind of being a dud.<br/><br/>Bottom Line - The original movie was a masterpiece. Everything after that was just struggling to recreate the magic.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Gave it your best shot didn't you? And that's what really matters in the end. I'm sorry for rating your movie a 3 because, after all, I know you're only 100 monkeys, so what did I expect? The thing is, even for 100 monkeys, I feel the ineptitude on display here is really alarming and I wonder if maybe fewer monkeys, maybe a dozen or so, could have come up with something more cohesive. I'm not even really sure where to start, if I'm honest with you monkeys. For one thing, just the entire framework is insane. In a film that is predicated on the idea that there are dinosaurs all over the place, it seems fairly obvious to me that the film should follow that rather than focus primarily on an entirely tangential evil corporation and their plot to control the food chain that has very little to do with dinosaurs. Indeed, it is as if only a handful of you 100 monkeys were even informed that you were supposed to be writing a Jurassic World movie, so few the dinosaurs are, though perhaps this is a concern best taken up with the 1000 monkeys at Universal. The dinosaurs do appear in infrequent doses, though oddly most of the dinosaurs are still captive dinosaurs that manage to escape captivity rather than the supposedly plentiful free-roaming dinosaurs. Doesn't make much sense now does it monkeys? No matter. The dialogue is awful in equal measure; I would suggest sticking to ""Ooh ooh aah ahh,"" from now on. Now, to change my tune a bit here monkeys, one area I think you might have been able to actually to contribute to would have been in the acting department. You couldn't have done worse than the humans did and you certainly would have been more lively. You probably also would have been better in the director's chair than Colin Trevorrow, though I suppose I don't where you would find 100 director's chairs. All in all monkeys, not your best work. But don't let this one failure stop you from writing more terrible movies. You've got the entire MCU to keep afloat as well, after all. Best of luck.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The previous films never held a candle to the original but they nevertheless had a cohesive plot we could grasp and follow the characters as they progressed through the dangers of Jurassic Park. I cannot say the same at all about this film. This film has more plot holes and poor character choices than a Steven Seagal film, it makes Jurassic Park 3 look like Citizen Kane. Bringing back the old characters felt more like window dressing out of nostalgia for the 1993 film rather than make them important characters in this film.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Been super hyped and left super impressed. Wasnt surprised about dodgson being a replaced actor though and a menace and dumb***. Also i dont understand the woke negativity of jurassic world 3. As i was completely fine with it and not seeing what the critics saw. The story was brilliant and thrilling and very action packed and menacing. And very adorable. And the legacy and current cast blending is somewhat outstanding. This movie gave me so many memories in many scenes with how the scenes played out. The issue is dont take someone to see a film if they dont understand the story arc. Just dont take anyone with you who lacks interest. Otherwise the experience for you will get ruined. Ive seen all the jurassic films going way back to the first film in 93. The hype for me was worth it and if your in the UK for 4.99 a ticket at VUE cinemas is so worth it. Make sure you bring a gallon of soda because you will get thirsty for 3hrs...</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park, always been. The new World series was not great but it had it's moments with a descent plot and dinosaurs being in the centre. I was looking forward to Dominion. Unfortunately, the third and final movie does not deliver and probably is the worst of all. I am not going to go into details but it feels as if someone wanted to record a movie with dinosaurs but lost the essence behind it. The film has a lot of dinosaurs in it, multiple species, but the randomness, poor plot and lack of heart from the director make this a forgettable experience.</div>

JW Fallen Kingdom ended in a high note and it settled the ground for a great third movie, instead of focusing on how the world deals with dinasaurs they focused in Teenage Mutant Bugs... for some reason??<br/><br/>Still, it's a fun movie and it was great to see Sam Neill and Laura Dern once again, Sam Neill steals the show with his charming, grumpy performance as Dr. Alan Grant.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Easily the worst movie in the series. Even for a Jurassic movie there is nothing that even remotely makes sense. The movie is absolutely for 9 year olds. It's extremely disappointing.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">47/2022. Cinema. One jump scare and two and a half hours of your life gone are all you'll get from this disappointing conclusion to a once awe-inspiring franchise.<br/><br/>Beyond the CGI nothing feels right. The dialogue, the performances, the predictable action sequences, the editing and pacing are all sub-par. The score that once evokes awe now feels limp and half-hearted.<br/><br/>As a long-time franchise fan I'm glad I didn't go to a midnight screening on release day last week.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">For the first time I was able to be present for an avant-premiere, the movie being 'Jurassic World Dominion' (2022) directed by Colin Trevorrow. The movie has stars like Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum. His is my personal, detailed rating of the movie based on multiple key aspects that I believe define what makes a movie good or bad. I watched the movie in cinemas (Laser Ultra) with my brother and we found it quite good; almost on par with the first Jurassic World and much better than Fallen Kingdom.<br/><br/>The story was quite refreshing for a Jurassic movie, since we finally got to see what it would be like if the dinosaurs actually escaped and lived among us. This was probably the most fascinating aspect of the story for me. The genetic manipulation 'arc' was also cool, but quite cliché and it was most likely used as a component for the action sequences to lean on.<br/><br/>Bringing back the original characters from the Jurassic Park movies was a great move and I loved it. Seeing the original actors reprise their roles as Ellie Sattler, Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm was heartwarming. I also really enjoyed Isabella Sermon as Maisie, I thought she was really the heart of the story as well as our precious Blue &amp; Beta<br/><br/>The cinematography was gorgeous. I mostly loved the scenes in the jungle/forest at night. The colors and vibe really gave me a OG Jurassic Park feels. The dinosaurs were obviously great as always and I enjoyed that there weren't any hybrid dinosaurs. Seeing some old classics return as well as our beloved T-rex and the raptors was satisfying.<br/><br/>The movie was scary at times which I loved. Not the point that you would scream but to the point that it would give you a good shake at least. The action sequences were groundbreaking, especially the dinosaur/motorcycle &amp; car chase in the middle of a city. The movie also knew well when to calm the audience and prepare them for the next action piece.<br/><br/>I did miss an emotional attachment to the characters since I kind of knew throughout the movie that nothing super bad was going to happen to them. I miss that feeling from the original Jurassic Park movies during which plenty of important characters lost their heads and lives.<br/><br/>The music and sound design was on point but nothing spectacular in my opinion, though I'm yet to listen to the OST separately. The pacing and runtime was just about right to get everything in without leaving too many plotholes.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was very fun to watch and definitely worth a 7/10. It misses the emotional attachment and stakes for me which takes away from the suspense factor - which is very important in these type movies. But overall, great watch and I definitely recommend it for the Jurassic fans.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Right from the beginning the story felt off even on Jurassic World franchise point. The story line quality degrade in every Jurassic World movies.<br/><br/>Too many characters are felt caricature. Too many Cliche. Copied so many scenes from Jurassic Park Franchise.<br/><br/>Spielberg's Jurassic Park is one of the masterpiece. This Jurassic World movies are literally butchering the name.<br/><br/>After watching this piece of crap i still believe Jurassic Park by Spielberg is miles.. miles.. miles ahead of these movies.<br/><br/>Coming to the story, they really tried to put two stories in one movie. That resulted messy storyline, messy screenplay, unnecessary characters just comes and goes for no reason at all.<br/><br/>There is no proper establishment in story for the locations where the movie takes place.<br/><br/>2nd act and 3rd/Final act is all over the place with zero sense of things happening.<br/><br/>1st act felt more like Kidnapping movie with few Dinosaurs. With a lot of scenes which have no sense at all.<br/><br/>Too many Repeatedly used dialogues. Thriller scenes have no base or sense what so ever. Thrilling scenes are there just to fill the run time of the movie. Only good thing are VFX and The Dinosaurs. Nothing else.<br/><br/>It's better to watch Spielberg's brilliantly directed movie Jurassic Park or even The Lost World.<br/><br/>Final verdict:- This is a big budget messy Movie with too many references from Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Direction: 4/10
Screenplay: 3/10
Dialogues: 4/10
VFX: 9/10
Cinematography: 7/10

<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Jurassic World Dominion"" is an entertaining movie whose script is full of fanservice, especially for those like me who loved the first movie, it's quite nice to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum together again. In terms of logic, the script has many flaws that are justified by the science fiction theme that the film touches on. The soundtrack is good, especially the theme used in suspenseful scenes. The cinematography is powerful and provides some great visuals. The performances are good and the director does a good job. An entertaining movie but with nothing more to offer.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic Park was wonderful. Very good adaptation of Crichton's novel. The sequels? Meh and more meh. And Dominion is a perfect example of how Hollywood has *one* good idea and then beats it into the ground over and over because they have no imagination or creativity.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about Dominion is that I got to watch it for free, so I wasn't out any money on it.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I have reached at a phase in my life where I have learnt to be unbiased in my judgement of films even if it features my favourite stars. But like everything other facet of life, this principle also has its exceptions - I cannot help but be biased about the Jurassic Park films and there are several factors contributing to that bias:
1. My love for films kick-started with ""Jurassic Park"" (the first film I had watched at a theatre, way back in 1994) and that film and most of its scenes have become iconic over the years - a feat unmatched by any monster film of the past and the present.<br/><br/>2. Having watched the original in 1994, the child has ever since been fascinated by the jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring dinosaurs. They had occupied a world of fantasy for the kid who was by nature an introvert. From collecting dino toys to owning dino t-shirts, I have done it all and continue to do it now, when given a chance, as I am still preoccupied by these mighty beasts.<br/><br/>3. The sequels and the spin-offs to the original have had hits and misses in them, never touching the iconic moments of the original but have always continued to be watchable even now. I didn't like ""Jurassic Park III"" but I have never overlooked it, having watched it multiple times as well. Despite the flaws, they define an integral part of my childhood and every new film is a stroll down the lanes of nostalgia for this 31-year old guy. They are special to me, no matter what.<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion takes place four years after the cataclysmic events of the previous film and the dinosaurs are out in the human world. They are colliding into one another and learning to live together as well. Metaphor for COVID-19? Yes, could be. The film also touches on issues like food scarcity and plagues and the side effects of bioengineering in agriculture. It is in some of these moments in the first half that the film suffers from pacing issues and from lack of being in a tight knot. But once the pre-interval scene comes up, the film changes track. The scene changes to the park and the essence of Jurassic Park is back. There are numerous dinosaurs, scene after scene, some new (like the Therizinosaurus, the Pyroraptor, the Atrociraptor, and the big daddy of them all - the Giganatosaurus) and some old (like the Velociraptors, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the venom-spitting Dilophosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, among many others) - a dream world for a dino lover like me. The cinematography is jaw-dropping and the mixture of special effects and animatronics seal the deal effectively well. Despite the flaws in the screenplay, the film is salvaged by the breathtaking second half. Among the actors, Bryce Dallas Howard gets the best character arc and newcomer DeWanda Wise turns in a commendable performance. But it was great fun to watch the OG cast - the dynamics between the trio of Alan, Ellie, and Ian can beat any newcomer, after all they are the heart of the franchise and it was worth having them to close the chapters on dinosaurs forever.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">As a film this final installment in the 'Jurassic Park' franchise suffers from many ailments but as a conclusion to a fan favourite it manages to deliver a small sliver of fun and fulfilment.<br/><br/>The narrative is oddly and clunkingly constructed, the direction is staggeringly flat and undramatic, the cast is left with hardly any meat on the bones of their characters, the editing is ferociously vicious whilst the films score is bland and unmemorable. Costumes and sets are drab thought the special effects and makeup artists have done reasonable work. Fair but not exceptional.<br/><br/>The first half of the narrative is plainly bad and contrived nonsense and whilst this interminable imbecility continues to the end the second half of the film does build some fun and adventure as it settles into the familiar structure of stranded humans suffering dinosaur attentions in a disintegrating dinosaur facility whilst trying to save a token item.<br/><br/>As a fan film the re-emergence of the original cast as the principle players is welcome as a replacement to the wafer thin newer cast and the jarringly constructed conceit of another dinosaurs park going belly up allows for familiar survival routines.<br/><br/>This can not obscure thought the sad situation that the whole thing is a mess: very small ideas blown beyond any proportions to a protracted runtime and un-involving action scenarios.<br/><br/>Overall I had the almost constant sense that 'Jurassic World Dominion ' has been savaged in post production editing to bring a sprawling tale down to a 2 and a half hour runtime. This has unfortunately increased the sense of muddled structure in the narrative and in individual scenes.<br/><br/>The effects are of inconsistent quality: some highly effective and some much less so. The sound design and cinematography are solidly unremarkable however some audio design for the dinosaurs are powerful.<br/><br/>There is no attempt at believable violence or kinetic action: it is very bloodless and off camera in its kills and the action is frankly awfully developed.<br/><br/>There is however a clear attempt to build on the human versus technological exploitation of life but it's muddled and unconvincing for me in how these themes are implemented in this story.<br/><br/>I rate a 3/10 as a feature film but 4/10 as a franchise instalment and give a compound score of 3.5/10.<br/><br/>I recommend only to confirmed fans due to the resurgence of the more interesting and engaging original cast and actors. I do not consider this film to be very good but it is not a complete failure at drawing the Jurassic Park world into broader sci-fi tropes whilst rounding off the tale of the current characters.<br/><br/>If this franchise is to return then the young adulthood of Maisie Lockwood a few years hence from the current continuity looks likely to be the viable starting point.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World: Dominion bites off far more than it can chew. Blending the old characters with the new doesn't work as well as in other franchises and it takes far too long for certain characters to meet. 2 and a half hours is a slog for any movie and this doesn't warrant it. There are some nice set pieces but it is weighed down by some clunky dialogue and Jurassic World 3 is ultimately a disappointment. Chris Pratt said this was Jurassic Park's Endgame...he couldn't have been further off the mark on that one.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have been a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise since the 1990's. This final story is a huge disappointment. You would think with this cast, the story would explode and you would leave the theater satisfied. I left disappointed and ashamed for the scriptwriters and actors. The story was disjointed and most of the actors were just there. Jeff Goldblum had his occasional dry humor that shined through but that's about all that shined. Chris Pratt lacked any of the charm he displayed in Jurassic World. All-in-all...giving this movie a 3 rating was kind. Save your money and wait for it to come to Netflix where you can watch it at no additional cost.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I was a bit unsure about this because looking at the reviews of the previous two movies or so, a lot of the reviews weren't too kind which surprised me because I thought they were tolerable. Jurassic world dominion isn't very logical, it's hard to imagine most of the scenarios, there's people constantly outrunning trained assassin dinosaurs, so much of the plot line is dependent on coincidences that realistically speaking aren't supposed to be in the ""good guys"" favor, happens once... that's alright, but the movie is littered with them. We have people who've never met and literally have no real connection somehow suddenly willing to risk their lives and everything else to help each other, they lack character depth but from the little we know don't really seem like the type. The movie tries to subtly be humorous but the only scene that made me chuckle was the 'pullover the plane to the side' otherwise most of the jokes don't land as hard as they're intended. The dinosaurs behavior was way out of character, especially when they were mingling with the rest of modern wildlife, just hard to believe. You see, a lot of the movie is unbelievable and you could keep on rambling about it; if you over analyze it you'll realize there's so many aspects of it that are way off and could be better and you end up not enjoying it... but it's a dinosaur movie, I think you should just look at as just that; entertainment not a piece of art. I acknowledge it isn't a great movie, but I enjoyed it and it's worth a watch. It's also a decent family movie.<br/><br/>I watched a recap of the entire franchise and I must say it has really come from far and the recent releases have adapted the story with the times to make it more modern which ended up with fatuous plotlines like breeding animals for military use and all that, like if that made sense they'd have tried conscripting rhinos first. But none of it is as silly as fast and furious for example. If you're going to watch this with a keen eye and all you really won't enjoy it.<br/><br/>My only major complaint is they tried to give it a heartfelt send off at the end with the emotional happy ending, sigh of relief, everybody coming together, it's all love music and it really wasn't giving man, I didn't care of the characters for that scene to deliver what the writers or directors thought it was giving. The movie had to be better than it actually was for that ending to mean something and that annoyed me. It's not an epic conclusion as advertised.<br/><br/>It is a long movie as well, I don't think it had to be that long and if it was paced better could have shortened the runtime and made it more thrilling as the action was subpar. If I'm not mistaken, this is intended to be the last release in the franchise, and for that I'm a little upset because there was a huge time leap, about thirty years since dinosaurs were released and I'm sure amazing stories could have come from that, while this movie followed a more generic and more imaginative story.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't think it's an absolute catastrophe but if you head into this with expectations, you'll be disappointed. I didn't have any and thought it was bearable.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">A hilarious mixture of fan service, bad writing and dino action. This movie has three plots and it can't decide whether the stars are the new characters or the old ones. The villain looks like Tim Cook and apparently he's supposed to be the guy Wayne Knight talked to at a tropical island in the original?! Jeff Goldblum steals the movie but he's not in it enough. I didn't think it was possible to make a movie worse than Fallen Kingdom but I think they somehow did. I feel bad for anybody who was hoping for a good movie at this point.<br/><br/>On an unrelated note there were only like 9 people in the cinema when I saw this including me and my sisters. After the climax the people behind me got up and left before the credits even began. These movies are nothing but visual noise at this point.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was better than the 2nd, on par with the first. Why the low reviews? The CGI was top notch as expected. The DNA plot line was a little confusing here as it was in the second one but they recapped it nicely. I love the addition of the older cast from the JP series. This had a very satisfying end to the series. What's next? A reboot?</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Banging around to all points on the globe, this synthetic, committee-written, mess recalls too many old characters and introduces too many new characters who take turns being nipped at by expertly created dinos at well-timed intervals. As usual, a rich white man is the source of all evil and characters of various ethnicities and sexual orientations save the day. If it was written by a computer, kudos to the programmer. If it was written by humans, I need to check your papers... and your pulse.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now you may see the 3/10 rating and assume I didn't enjoy Jurassic Park 6: The Rise of Allen Grant, but I loved it. It was big, stupid and silly and it as hilarious. There is one scene where Jeff Goldblum picks up a flaming stick and thrusts it down a massive dino's mouth, only for the dinosaur to start breathing fire. Now if you think I'm lying, go see the movie yourself. It's without a doubt so bad it's good and gets a recommendation from me. The one complaint I have is the length. Two and a half hours is long for any movie, especially a terrible one. But if you've got three hours to kill and enjoy stupid schlock, then you'll enjoy yourself.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I was 8 when the first JP came out so obviously I'm a big fan of the original. I was also a big fan of JW when it came out, I've played both the JWE games too.<br/><br/>So to finish the series with a very mediocre film is just downright disheartening.<br/><br/>JW2 was a let down but it ended with such promise it was merely a stepping stone to get to THIS, THE SHOWDOWN, MAN VS DINOSAUR.<br/><br/>And it just didn't happen, if anything this was worse than JW2.<br/><br/>Now seeing the original cast back was cool, but it didn't solve the plethora of problems with the film. CGI was great and the actors put in good performances but I don't think anything could save this from the terrible story.<br/><br/>Now the film does pickup A LOT in the last 40 mins or so, but the ending is terrible, no solution, no answers, no....ending tbh. It was almost like they were leaving it open for another sequel, but by making 2 bad films in a row I really think the box office would be WAY down for another one.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible film and it's not a good film, IT'S NOT WHAT WE WANTED I cant tell you that!!!!<br/><br/>It's probably above JP3 and below JW2 but an average film that squandered the opportunity to be absolutely epic makes me feels like I've been ripped off, money wise and hype/waiting wise.<br/><br/>This could have been the best in the series and I'm gutted that,it wasn't.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The original Jurassic Park is a classic. Steven Spielberg created a sense of wonder with his great direction and some very good CGI and practical effects. It was very sispenful at times but mostly audiences lived the dinosaurs. The scene when we see the T-Rex is one of the great sequences in cinema. Since that first film in 1993 I have gone from not.liking the sequels to ultimately thinking that the franchise never could recreate what made the first film so special...None of the Jurassic Park or Jurassic World films are terrible but none of them hold a candle to the original film.<br/><br/>When Jurassic World came out I liked it but it just seemed it wasn't that memorable. Fallen Kingdom came next and I just didn't like it.<br/><br/>This new film is being sold as an epic conclusion and they brought back three of the main characters from the first film. So obviously they are selling nostalgia, which is fine and it's been done incessantly since The Force Awakens was so successful. If done right? It works. If not it seems like desperation. Here it is pretty flat. The inclusion of Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, and Ian Malcolm is to me anti-climactic. Sam Neil, Laura Deen and Jeff Gold Blum are ok as these characters and but it just seems they were brought in for nostalgia and it doesn't work as much as it should. Even though the first film is beloved I don't consider these characters as beloved so it's nice to see them but it's like seeing Harrison Ford as Han in Episode 7. It's of course a fusing of the new characters from the old franchise and the new ones. Chris Pratt is fine as Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire are is ok too but nothing new happens with these characters.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs of course are the reason to see these films and some scenes are really well done but again the sense of wonder is gone. The story is just the standard science for profit yarn mixed in with the kidnapping of the cloned girl from Fallen Kingdom. As with so many 3rd parts of a trilogy it is very overstuffed and feels unfocused fur the first half of the running time but once it gets going it does get fun. But like so many blockbusters these days you pretty much forget it by the time you leave the theater.<br/><br/>I can say I liked it but felt that we didn't get the epic conclusion that it was sold as.<br/><br/>Grade: B-</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">So it wasn't the best Jurassic movie ( that will always be the original and best) but it was choc full of dinosaurs, some old, some new and the two casts got together .. it was just good fun and I believe they wrapped it up well.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie's plot makes zero sense; people go back and forth to far off locations in no time and also dinosaurs inconceivably show up in logistically illogical places. They dumbed down the OG cast and gave them barely anything to do. The whole movie is just a mix of predictable jump scares mixed with Fast and the Furious like action scenes that does nothing to the plot.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">10 story arcs. 10 plot hole ladened story arcs. 10 story arcs with continual tropes. The film company said ""what stories do we have for a 3rd film?"" Every writer responded and the company said ""Yes! Let's do them all!""
Bigger stories, with bigger monsters must mean more money to them.<br/><br/>A popcorn flick is a simple story, with good action, engaging enough characters to bring you along for the ride one that knows it's not serious. This is not that movie. Flat, no humor, dull, no life, spiritless, soulless, are all words to describe this film.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Where to even begin...?<br/><br/>I LOVE JP1, JP2 was ok, JP3 was also just ok. JW1 was good! JW2 sucked. JW3 was BORING!<br/><br/>The main issue I had with this film. The entire, 'GENERIC EVIL COMPANY KIDNAPS SOMEONE UNIQUE, &amp; OUR .... dinosaur SCIENTISTS.... Suddenly are now essentially, Ethan Hunt, Jason Bourne, &amp; James Bond'...<br/><br/>The first 1+ HOUR is absolutely nothing but a kid/rescue mission... oh, you thought about maybe a... DINOSAUR!? Haha no silly... a cloned teenage girl, OBVIOUSLY!<br/><br/>I am not even joking. They even use those ridiculous titles to show ""we are now in UTAH"" ""VEGAS"", ""MALTA"" .... MALTA!?!? Yeah. They pretty much cover the planet to rescue this girl.<br/><br/>The 'bad guy' is SO generic, that I honestly don't remember his name. He also has some super meanie assassin type guys working for him, but don't worry guys!!! Because Chris Prats character is able to drive through buildings &amp; even up stairs on his motorcycle, &amp; Bryce Dallas' character...? The woman who basically just ran the control room of the new park? Yeah, in this one she is LITERALLY in a chase scene, jumping across rooftops..lol... seriously, this was EVERY mid 2010s action film, with some dinosaurs thrown in.<br/><br/>Oh.. a member of the evil genius group also has a laser pointer that upon pointing it at someone? Raptors suddenly go after them as if it's a dinosaur homing beacon lol. (Don't ask me how it works, it's never said...)<br/><br/>Apparently whenever there is a 65 million yr old meat eating dinosaur about to attack you... all you need to do is hold up your hand, as if you can use 'The Force' lol seriously... multiple people do... why would this work??? It's cringe after the 10th time.<br/><br/>Oh... &amp; a character actually makes a ""promise"" to find a dinosaurs baby, &amp; it's supposed to be a dramatic moment, &amp; someone a row down I actually heard scoff &amp; say, ""did he just give his word to a lizard""? Lol!! Yeah, he did lol.<br/><br/>Twists &amp; surprises? Yeah, those don't exist here. I knew everything that was going to happen, it was kind of pathetic how bad the script was. At NO point will you feel that any character is ever going to die.<br/><br/>The new 'bad' Dino? It's just once again another, ""biggest carnivore to ever live"" gimmick. Aaaand the final climatic battle? I'd say lasts around... 2 minutes? I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs look worse than ANY of the 5 other films. In daylight they look ridiculously fake.<br/><br/>Original cast played no real purpose, plot wise. They were only to sell tickets.<br/><br/>IF you discount the entire first HOUR+ of the stupid kidnap thing... then I could probably say, ""it wasn't too bad"" ... however, given that this had more in common with Mission Impossible, than J. P.... It isn't good.<br/><br/>During the 1st hour, I kept recalling Ian Malcom from JP1... ""Are there any DINOSAURS on this DINOSAUR tour??"" Haha.<br/><br/>One of the all time franchises... it's become nothing more than a poorly written, bloated pointless script, with some of the more questionable CGI you'll ever see on a 1 billion dollar earner....<br/><br/>Wish I'd just seen TOP GUN, again.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Colin Trevarrow has hit the final nail on the franchise's coffin by deviating from the central dinosaur themed storyline, with bland dinosaur shots, introducing new uninteresting characters and a weak antagonist. The movie takes inspiration from modern day kaiju movies where the characters are secondary to the primary monster duels which has greatly affected the orginal franchise's plot and character based storyline. The movie could have been directed better by Michael Bay with more explosions and no dinosaurs. The movie makes dinosaur lovers grind their teeths in frustration. Overall a disappointing conclusion to a great franchise.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This is going to be an informal review as I do not care enough for this film. Also I haven't slept in over 10 hours so let's make this quick.<br/><br/>This is the worst film in the Jurassic franchise, it is trash, it is garbage, it is a dumpster fire. Terrible writing, terrible dialogue that will leave you shaking your head. No one, and I mean no one could've saved this film it was doomed from conception. I love Michael Giacchino but holy crap was this score horrible it did nothing to elevate what was happening on screen but then you don't care enough anyway so how can it. This film is two hours, and twenty six minutes long, and I felt every minute. It's also two hours, and twenty six minutes too long.<br/><br/>This film is also wrongly titled ""Jurassic World Dominion"" ""Dominion"" implies these dinosaurs would be occupying the Earth almost similar to Planet of the Apes. Yet instead of dinosaurs ruling the Earth we are treated to a dull, boring story about the environment, and how we are destroying the environment. Typical of Hollywood to peddle this liberal trash! Not only does this film suffer from a bad title but also it's tone, it's all over the place. This film doesn't know what it wants to be.<br/><br/>There's no redeeming factors here, the original characters add nothing except to fuel ticket sales. Also for the return of Dodgson well Wayne Knight said it best in Jurassic Park ""Dodgson we got Dogson here"" and nobody cares. Apparently all the main characters have a super power that stops dinosaur attacks by just rasing their hand, like what the hell kind of plot armor bull is that. This film is The Rise of Skywalker to the Jurassic franchise, the only good here is that it's finally over. Ever since the original Jurassic Park this franchise has gone down hill.<br/><br/>I expected trash yet somehow they've still managed to disappoint. With this film they've done the impossible I'd rather watch Fallen Kingdom. Normally I would always encourage others to watch, and judge for yourself but I can't do that. Save yourself, save your money, and save your time. Instead watch Top Gun: Maverick in theaters or literally anything else.<br/><br/>IMDb: 1/10

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can see clearly why critics have described this instalment in the franchise as a mash up. Key characters from previous movies thrown together into reminiscent past iconic scenes to loosely follow the very basic park plot. The characters are cardboard play pieces with mundane dialogue that goes nowhere. Not only was the monster dinosaurs recycled, but also some familiar dinosaurs from two decades ago (still filmed as obvious mechanical puppets). In conclusion, I struggle to avoid falling asleep watching a midday Jurassic Park reunion anniversary style movie special. Hopefully in future instalments they might actually create a decent interesting thrilling mature script around the existence of dinosaurs roaming in the human world. Previous two movies in recent years are brilliant. And the original three movies were magical. This movie was a boring letdown.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The only momment satisfied me was that seeing Dr. Grant and Dr. Ellie together again, everything else just was unbearable: the lazy scripting, poorly written conversation, over-the-place film flow, lame music, super-hero character, cliche action, random &amp; lack of coherent cut scences... like you put all materials of JP + JW, mix them all together and hope new movie finds a way?! No, just same thing but different labelling number! What is the good VFX for if the story does not tell the story????<br/><br/>Could not belive they can do this to their fans. Contradicting to the promise of the director, this final chapter delivers nothing but disappointment and anger! I respect the crew, cast and all the efforts they put into making this but to me, the movie is a flop.<br/><br/>Would not recommend to watch in theater. Big no no!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This movie is an outrage to the original work.<br/><br/>I mean, everything that is beautiful and astonishing in the Jurassic Park concept is completely absent in this film.<br/><br/>They actually shot a movie that looks like it came out of the monsterverse (but of poor quality), taking out the dinosaurs and adding random stuff. If already in the first two of the World saga, the creatures have completely stopped behaving like animals but have been humanized to excess (do you remember the smile of the indoraptor? I remember it while I sleep), here they are a simple outline to totally unrelated events. The cast is simply out of control. The only positive aspect that comes to mind about this so-called movie is that Crichton is no longer with us and he would not be able to witness this abomination. Trevorrow had the incredible merit of making me reevaluate Star Wars episode IX.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World Dominion might not be THE best of the franchise, but it is what it intends to be: a good follow-up and conclusion to the original story. The film has a lot of excellent action sequences, especially the one involving a bike. The pacing is also good, even though the tempo infrequently drops a bit. Seeing it in 3D was another plus, as the film features gorgeous locales and eye-popping visual effects. It intends to be a fun popcorn action movie for the family this summer, and succeeds in being so. Take your kids and friends along for this ultimate dinosaur action entertainer and the film will keep you thoroughly entertained just like the previous ones.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I decided to watch all 3 over the last two days and yes this is the best one. It is heavily carried by the original Jurassic Park cast and compared to the other two it definitely has the most interesting concept for a story.<br/><br/>I've noticed several things from a full rewatch, they have learned a little but not enough. The references in this one are a little more subtle minus the obvious Barbasol can and the original trio still wearing the same outfit after 30 years (but I can let that slide), they've learned that if T-Rex fights another dinosaur the T-Rex has to win. And on a similar note, everyone has wanted that Ellie and Alan relationship, maybe not via the Jurassic World franchise but it still works even if it is only due to the characters.<br/><br/>The main failing of all of these movies is that there is far too much useless action, all of it you see coming a mile off especially since it will foreshadow and heavily wink at you a minute or two beforehand. They reuse their own shots and tropes, this one yet again had several moments were predators duck down to look through a window. Movie logic may be a thing but many times they'll mention how fast and strong something is or how it is impossible to escape. These things will chase a motorbike/car/plane and then be outrun by a 14 year old girl. You never feel any danger because they're escaping so many times in the same way.<br/><br/>We have to see Owen Grady yet again do some taming of the raptor hand waving, multiple times in this movie. I may have praised the T-Rex has to win thing, but they literally did this in the last film including the fake out when it plays dead then teams up with a partner like they're in tag team wrestling matches. If you want to do that, fine do it once. I do like the introduction of new species, but they have to be the main focus they tried hard to wedge them in along with two other storylines and it becomes too much.<br/><br/>On top of that, the runtime really sags during it... in any action movie, the action should not be the thing making it feel bloated. This whole franchise could have been a lot better if they cut a lot of the action, especially since it really highlights that CGI still isn't perfect. The original had puppets and limited CGI plus they knew how to hide it a little better. Don't get me wrong the older movies effects have still aged but you can forgive it as it is but a tiny part of that movie. All three of these movies have a ton of it and less than half of it feels like there is another living being on screen.<br/><br/>In terms of what is good, story wise I did like the basic premise although the execution of it was essentially like if Steve Jobs ran Monsanto. ""Stylish"" billionaire genetically modifying seeds for profit (plus locusts and dinosaurs on the side?). As previously mentioned the original cast still clearly have chemistry, comedic timing and are good actors and they're the biggest reason to watch this. I still like seeing Dr Wu in these movies, he is a bit of a cartoon villain but i'm absolutely fine with that.</div>

I thought it was great how they worked the original cast into the new movie. Also, there was a lot of cameos from previous cast members. Was it my favorite Jurassic park movie? No, I like both originals (Jurassic world and Jurassic Park) the best. But, I thought this was much better than Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. Don't go by the bad reviews if you like the Jurassic movies you will love this.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now I said it already - ""best Jurassic movie so far"" - and ok, I'll happily admit I didn't have too high expectations, because I didn't like the previous two installments much tbh, but this one, at first I was thinking ""pretty slow start"", followed by ""but hey, they're actually building up a pretty good story that makes me care about what happens to the characters next"" and with a drive of a star wars or James Bond movie keeping your attention, and with pretty good CGI supporting the story, not the other way around. No honestly, this felt like a more ""mature"" Jurassic movie compared to previous ones, I really enjoyed this one and left the movie theatre with a big smile on my face - this is what a night at the movies is all about.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The good:
Jeff Goldblum still has got his usual wit, but he only stars in it for less than 10 minutes. Bummer. It's the other 2 old stars (Laura Dern and Sam Elliot) who carry this movie and they do perform (as expected) quite well.<br/><br/>More good: this is a popcorn blockbuster made to numb our brains with mindless entertainment and it succeeds at that quite well, up to a point though....<br/><br/>The bad:
First of all I must confess that I was NOT impressed with the special effects of the dinosaurs. There were several cringy moments that looked so fake, but this isnt my biggest gripe..<br/><br/>More bad:
Despite all the contineous pumped up action this latest (final?) edition is quite tedious to watch at the end. The first hour is allright, but 30 minutes of the end part should really have been cut out of this movie, because IT LASTS TOO LONG, which made me start looking at my watch when it would be over. NOT a good sign...<br/><br/>It'll do for some mindless entertainment and the former Jurassic Park fans will go and see this latest movie anyway, but dont get your hopes up, because this edition is one of the worst...</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I personally thought that this final chapter was done amazingly.<br/><br/>The live action dinosaurs and CGI versions of the dinosaurs were ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. They all looked so real. This movie also had THE MOST scenes with the live action puppet versions of the DINO's... and all together the most scenes with dinosaurs than any other previous movie.<br/><br/>I see many reviews complaining about the ""lack of"" story about dinosaurs... that's completely not true in any fashion. They do have a few storylines consisting of several non important stories that bring ALL the characters together in the final act. But how much more could the story tellers teach us about these dinosaurs we've seen and studied since the original Jurassic Park in 1993??!!?? We know how they were made and how they've evolved the past 29 years.<br/><br/>In closing... THIS MOVIE WAS VISUALLY STUNNING, SCARY, &amp; BEAUTIFULLY PUT TOGETHER. The story was great for each and every character. A beautiful ending to an amazing franchise that has spanned over almost 30 years.<br/><br/>I'm very excited where they will take this franchise next??!! I hope they continue with a new storyline and new characters in the next 5 years!<br/><br/>If you're a fan of any Jurassic movie... you will definitely love this action filled, dinosaur packed finale! Trust me, you'll be glad you got to see this in the theater and on the big screen! We went to IMAX to see the film this evening.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just can't believe how bad this movie is. One of the lamest, most pathetic, banal and uninteresting movies I've ever seen. It couldn't be farther from the original Jurassic Park, in any possible way. The acting is quite bad, everything is sooo predictable, dinosaurs have almost no relevance to the plot, but the worst thing is the amount of cheesy cheap good feelings the movie is packed with, those murdering monsters being treated like pets... What an incredible waste of money and time (both theirs and mine).</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">In being a very loud, sometimes mindlessly entertaining, but ultimately kind of empty third part of a trilogy, Jurassic World Dominion feels a bit like Star Wars Episode 9: Rise of Skywalker. Dominion may be a little better, but not by much, and I was a little disappointed in the end.<br/><br/>I know a lot of more serious film fans weren't really hopeful for this, but I was cautiously optimistic it was going to be good. The last instalment ended with a good set-up for a sequel (dinosaurs roaming free in the human world) and it was good to hear that the first movie's trio of main characters were returning. Also, Jurassic World (2015) I remember being fun, and Dominion has the same director, so things were shaping up decently.<br/><br/>The film doesn't come close to achieving its full potential, but I don't think it completely squanders it either. I think there are fun scenes and some good ideas that aren't fully realised. Unsurprisingly, it's at its best when it makes use of the whole dinosaurs running free in the real world. All the action at the halfway point was so stupid but also really entertaining- car chases, parkour, gunfights, and hand-to-hand fights, all including dinosaurs. It kind of felt like The Bourne Identity but with dinosaurs for a bit there, and if it had more stupid and entertaining stuff like that, I would've been happy.<br/><br/>But the whole finale ends up taking place in yet another closed off facility, and mostly in the dark, so they can hide some of the imperfect special effects in the shadows (and felt like the effects here were weirdly inconsistent). There's fun to be had with Neill, Dern, and Goldblum returning. They're not squandered or just there as cameos, but like the other good things here, they're not used as well as they could have been.<br/><br/>I can't deny most of the dinosaur scenes were fun. There was some silly action and goofy set pieces that were entertaining. It wasn't a boring movie, but it was a messy one, with three or four different storylines all jammed into one movie, and just not enough done with the premise of dinosaurs and humans having to co-exist. It's overall disappointing, but if you have a soft spot for dinosaurs or big monster movies like me, it's not a completely irredeemable disaster.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">As a child of the 90's, there's an undeniable joy in returning to the world of roaming dinosaurs that happens to include human inhabitants in the form of Jurassic Park stars Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum but sadly despite a strong sense of nostalgia and joy seeing the veterans return to the property that made such a splash back in 90's, the finale to the Jurassic brand Dominion is a paint by numbers blockbuster that ends up being an experience more akin to the divisive Lost World and the often ridiculed third entry that many fans would choose to forget exists.<br/><br/>Overseen by returning director Colin Trevorrow, who takes over directing duties once more after setting up this new era with 2015's Jurassic World and skipping out of 2018's Fallen Kingdom which was helmed by J. A. Bayona, Dominion is a big film in more ways than one and has the tricky task of balancing numerous plot lines with an abundance of characters that have to intermingle the old with the new and its a balancing act Trevorrow never comes to grips with as the film he produces weaves in and out of various states, ranging from the boring, the ridiculous and the entertaining.<br/><br/>Moving away from the island setting that has been a staple of the series across previous entries, allowing the whole globe to play a part in this dino-lead chaos opens up a lot of potential doors in a narrative sense but for the most part Dominion unfortunately gives out short straws for its prehistoric critters with the tiresome humans and even bizarrely gigantic locusts hogging far too much of the screen-time, even if the mostly brief and well staged dinosaur moments showcase where the film could've become far more memorable overall if it had chosen to shy away from trying to create too many emotional/witty interactions with its humans.<br/><br/>In amongst this loud, brash and totally bonkers film, that see's our team of do-gooders head to Italy to stop some nefarious genetic experiments while battling an as to be expected dinosaur outbreak in a remote facility is a loaded cast of series staples but while the appearance of Neill, Goldblum and Dern is enjoyable there's a feeling that Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard walk away with the best moments in the film, even if Pratt feels more as though his going through the motions here, far removed from his energetic first turn as Owen Grady way back in 2015.<br/><br/>At days end its hard to exactly know how long-term fans of the Jurassic series are going to feel about this expensive and instantly forgettable outing, on one hand it gives them another chance to see those they know and loved in action once more but you can't help escape the feeling that there was a far better way to utilise their presence than what is done here and after this next generation of Jurassic action was started out solidly in 2015, in 2022 we culminate this period with a whimper not a bang, making this a rather sorry finale to a property with more downs than ups.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Not a complete dumpster fire but not the fitting return of past characters or finale one might've hoped for, Jurassic World Dominion does a few things right but with too much time dedicated to its humans not its creatures and an overall sense of mundanity, this blockbuster is unlikely to create much of a stir now or into the future.<br/><br/>2 1/2 coathangered dinosaurs out of 5<br/><br/>For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">However If you wanted a movie as magical as the first jurassic park then you'll be very disappointed. I won't lie. Seeing the original cast talk to jurassic world characters was fun and retconning the jp 3 events basically but not really with Sadler being single so her and Alan can be together was great. Laura Dern, Sam neil, Jeff Goldblum, Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard. All fantastic actor legendary actor current new actors. Dinosaurs. Awesome. Very fun and cool to see. However. Alot of the Dinosaurs served no purpose much to the plot and was just there to make scenes relevant and have a good chase. There were some parts where I thought I was watching fast and furious with Dinosaurs at some points. I hope universal don't try such a stupid concept as that. It was better than that awful fallen kingdom. That was the worst. This was maybe about 3rd worst with jp3 being the second worst and fallen kingdom THE worst. If I could never see this film again. I'd be happier. Not a great film. It was cool in some scenes but had no plot. It was just save the little girl and stop a villain format. Overused and boring. Not the type of movie to end the franchise on. It barely even showed blue. I understand what they wanted with blue, ok she's a tamed raptor. But why not show other raptors? LIKE BLUE IS THE ONLY RAPTOR YOU SEE. OTHER THAN BETA AND HER SIBLINGS DYING IN JW ITS JUST HER. THE RAPTORD IN THAT CHASE WERE HYBRIDS. I mean do we really need hybrids. Takes the fun out Dinosaurs. I think the cast was great and the Dinosaurs were cool but it just didn't have a story. Do better universal. Fire Colin Trevorow Because he can't direct and let stephen Spielberg do a sequel and only if it's worth it but it's unlikely.</div>

2. Lazy Writing beyond description
3. Messy Script<br/><br/>Fallen Kingdom also suffered from the same issues and they literally carry on some of the weakest plot points of the last one and I firmly believe in that the movie could have utilize a longer runtime. Again this shouldn't have been the end of the saga. Utterly huge letdown.<br/><br/>1993 Jurassic Park,directed by Spielberg is still uniquely unbeatable.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you rated this movie poorly you never liked Jurassic Park or any of the movies. If you think it had no plot, please, tell me the plot of the first?<br/><br/>This movie was so intelligent<br/><br/>This movie shows the events of what happened after Dinos were unleashed worldwide. Secretive companies have been creating more Dinos and poachers are hunting them. Not only that, they are used for underground ""dog fights"".<br/><br/>In the movie, maisie is being searched for because she is unnatural, so Owen and Claire are hiding her. They run into blue and her baby who have made their nest nearby. At the same time plant and nature specialist, Ellie, has noticed Jurassic era locust destroying food and gaining in herd size.<br/><br/>So many JP 1 references...rebooting the system...getting in the upside down far...Ian getting the Dino's attention with light...the trex walking past a circle...<br/><br/>So many complaints about Dodson. Dodson knew about genetics in JP1. Is it so unbelievable that he could become a master villain in 20-30 years?<br/><br/>This movie shows Dodson went back to get the barbidol can
Ramsey ""younger me"" is wearing a Bermuda shirt
Dodson dies thanks to dilaphosauruses carrying the exact same can<br/><br/>This movie touches another topic: the benefits and side effects of genetic manipulation. ""While they were off building theme parks she knew generic power could be used for good"" (just like in REAL LIFE) we never had a human made before. Just dinos.<br/><br/>Plus Wu finally learned his lesson. Brooklyn tried to tell him in Caml Cretaceous but he had to learn himself.<br/><br/>The truth is that this where JP was always headed: global coexistence with Dinos.<br/><br/>""If we are to survive we'll have to coexist""
That is the plot.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The marketing of this movie says ""a epic conclusion to jw"" but it's one of the most disappointing movies I ever seen, the plot is basically finding Nemo with endless action,dinosaurs and giant locusts,some characters are likable(Kayla and the og trio) some are okay(Ramsay and Owen) and others are Just meh(Maisie and others) they even don't die at the end only dodgson,side villains and backgound characters died, giga is more like vanny from fnaf sb rather than Joker he's barely in the final movie like vanny in fnaf sb but atleast vanny had a motivation since she was mind controled,giga is doing what a regular Animal does that makes the final battle pretty unfair and Dumb, this Felt less like a Jw movie but Felt more like a fast and furious movie with the dino action.</div>

Well.. nothing new: dinosaurs run and hunt, people run for their lifes, decent special effects, the old cast seems put there just to bring people to the teathers giving nothing! And, what the heck? Even in this movie we have gay characters???????? What the heck is wrong with Hollywood???? Really? A big budget with nothing interesting! This franchise seems to take the road of the Fast and Furious way: predictable and boring with full of cgi and that's all! If you like: boom, roaaaar, dinosaurs and mediocre acting, go see it!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic Park is a movie that I rewatch again and again and the believability factor reigns supreme. Unfortunately with this, I switched off from the very beginning-<br/><br/>Pros- Jeff Goldbloom, Sam Neill, somewhat nostalgic.<br/><br/>Cons- So many continuity errors, entomological inaccuracies, scientific inaccuracies, no flow (chaotic story telling- such a tendency nowadays to overstimulate the audience rather than captivate them, poor acting)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honestly impressed how they were able to make such a terrible movie. Terrible acting, terrible plot, too much set up, and not enough dinosaurs. The first two Jurassic worlds weren't great but they felt like the originals. Worlds can't even explain how awful this was. Boring and just too long. Also, many political undertones, I want to forget this movie, unfortunately I can't.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">IN A NUTSHELL:
I readily admit that I have been a huge fan of this dinosaur franchise since the very beginning. Not all of the movies in the series have been as good as others, but I've still enjoyed each one. From Jurassic World architect and director Colin Trevorrow, Dominion takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed. Dinosaurs now live-and hunt-alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.<br/><br/>Movie Review Mom GRADE: B<br/><br/>THINGS I LIKED:
I absolutely loved, loved, seeing the original cast members blend with the newer ones from the final trilogy. So fun! When Chris Pratt found out the old cast was returning, he excitedly claimed, ""Just in case you hadn't seen the news. It's finally happening. Get ready for what is absolutely, without a doubt going to be the biggest, baddest and best, movie of the franchise."" He also described this final episode like the Marvel ""Endgame"" of the Jurassic franchise.<br/><br/>The cast includes Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Lauren Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, BD Wong, Campbell Scott, Mamoudou Athie, Omar Sy, among others.<br/><br/>There are plenty of action sequences. Chris Pratt dropped weight and gained muscles to be in sharp form and is still absolutely believable as the action hero in the movie.<br/><br/>I loved that there was a plausible reason for bringing back a biologist and dinosaur expert in this movie.<br/><br/>We're also introduced to some new characters.<br/><br/>As filmmaking technology improves, the CGI of these movies gets more and more incredible. Even still, this addition to the franchise has even more animatronics than the last 2.<br/><br/>There are a lot of respectful nods to the first movie, which made me so happy. Easter eggs abound in visual and spoken forms.<br/><br/>We get to see a new kind of dinosaur called a ""Pyroraptor."" Fun! It was a real dinosaur recently discovered, but its size was supposedly smaller than a turkey.<br/><br/>We get to travel to destinations around the world.<br/><br/>It cracked me up when Jeff Goldblum's shirt was open and he said, ""Oh!"" ha ha He had some of the best lines of the movie, as always. There are a few moments worthy of a chuckle.<br/><br/>Every dinosaur we know and love from the previous movies gets a decent amount of screen time.<br/><br/>THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The last time we saw Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant, they were good friends, so I was surprised when they didn't even hug each other when they were first reunited in this movie.<br/><br/>I was surprised by the high number of bad editing moments.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm not the only Jeff Goldblum fan who wanted a more epic moment when we first saw him on screen in this movie.<br/><br/>There has been some criticism about the believability of the plot. Agreed.<br/><br/>It has been stated that this will NOT be the last film in the Jurassic Park franchise. Did you want this to be? Are you ready for more?<br/><br/>It's not really well explained how the land dinosaurs migrated to all of the continents around the world, just that they did.<br/><br/>Some of the new characters just aren't very compelling. Some are even annoying.<br/><br/>The plot and scenes are pretty chaotic and scattered.<br/><br/>I admit that the tension seemed fairly low simply because our favorite characters never seem to die. I wasn't really worried about them and didn't feel as emotionally invested in them as I was in the very first movie. SPOILER: Who knew just holding your hand out in front of a dinosaur was all it took?<br/><br/>Soooo many lines are repeated word for word from previous movies in the franchise. The first few times, it was charming, but then it kind of seemed manipulative and even lazy. A lot of the dialogue is clunky. Because of that, some of the acting suffers.<br/><br/>Is it terrible and crazy to admit that I was a little bit bored at times?<br/><br/>The villains are definitely underwhelming.<br/><br/>TIPS FOR PARENTS:
People and animals in perilous situations
Some profanity
A girl flips the bird
Young children might be frightened by the scary dinosaurs.<br/><br/>THEMES:
Technology
Nature
Balance
Friendship
Humanity vs. Animals<br/><br/>You can see the full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">My most anticipated movie of the last years. Especially when it was announced that my childhood heroes Grant, Sattler and Malcolm are coming back for it. So I was pumped.<br/><br/>The result -as expected with that level of expectation - was mediocre. But I am biased with my rating because I got my fan service and thats most I could ask for.<br/><br/>If you look rationally at it, it was not much of an innovative movie beside the fan service I was waiting for the past 30 years...
The plot is not really exisiting and pretty much all over the place. They had an opportunity with this one, showing the co-existence of man and dinosaur. However this was not really used just for a few scenes that didnt do much to the main plot because in the end they went back into a jungle and run away from monstersauruses as in the past films. Also during some phases of the film it felt like the dinosaurs are just playing a supporting part - instead we got giant bugs (?!?!) and a plot around a cloned child that was much more in the focus than anythng else.<br/><br/>Oh well... Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum got major of screentime so that's what saved it for me. Especially with a strong focus on Dern's Ellie Sattler which made me especially happy. She was great and perfecty back to the roots. While Sam Neill had his moments but he was a bit sleepwalking through it. I had the feeling they did not know how to focus on Jeff Goldblum except for the last third so he was a bit wasted, but as well as Dern he truly went back to the roots with his character. It was good the trio of legacy characters were back because Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard did not add anything to it. It always puzzled me why unexciting characters liek their Owen and Clair got to be major characters in a 3 of those films. This one showed most that there was nothing left to be added to their roles. No character development whatsover. The only real character development was seen in BD Wong's character but this was butchered and made no sense at all. I did not like Isabella Sermon who really did not act well (what was going on with her eyes all the times?). I liked a few new addtions most notably DeWanda Wise who possibly gave the best performance besides Laura Dern and Mamoudou Athie who was as always underrated. Campbell Scott made a decent villain but I really hated Dichen Lachman and was glad she had a rather minimal role. (Phew).<br/><br/>But agin I am biased so yes I like this movie. Its also by far not the worst of the franchise. We got a lot of great dino action, fantastic effects and locations (at one point it felt like a James Bond movie). Too bad they did not risk to break the formular though there were opportunities to do so. - Oh but then.... at one point they brought back the abandonded plot idea of the mid 00s when Dinosaurs were used as weapons.... I was scared for a second but this was just used for a few scenes in the mid section (again.. Phew!... because that was the point the movie really went down the hill but luckily it got back to familiar tracks in that case.<br/><br/>Oh well...good conclusion (or isn't it?) of a franchise even I as a major fan have to admit, is officially over now because there is really not much to tell anymore - and if you dare it anyway... it becomes a franchise about giant bugs or whatever....
Sorry for the good rating #fanboy.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Parents should know that Jurassic World Dominion is a fan movie. It really focuses on the characters wrapping up their storylines. And when it's not character driven, it's jump scare driven. While I would say it is not as violent as the previous films there are significantly more jump scare moments. The kid behind us seemed to be about 8 and left the movie crying. If your kids can handle the previous movies on the small screen, they will probably be able to handle this one on the small screen. But also be aware that a jump scare at home is a lot different than a jump scare on a giant theater screen. We really loved it though because of the way it positively represented biological and adoptive family members as well as adoptees. Find our full adoptive parent review on our blog. Down the Hobbit Hole Blog. Besides those points, it was very similar to the rest of the series. The cursing and bloodshed are about on par with the previous movies, possibly less. The movie concludes the entire Jurassic movie series (reportedly) and it was definitely made with the fans in mind.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The last Jurassic park series. So all Jurassic prark fans look forward to this movie. But result is very disappointing. The main character should be a dinosaur, not locuts, even humans. And the plot should also be about dinosur. So, I think the subplot of the dinosaur black market material should have been the main one. But it didn't. This movie's main plot about is to criticize the bioethics of Biosin thorough the Cretaceous Locusts. My opinion, the described locust was so detailed that it was gross. Giganotosaurus, the main villain dinosaur, is also a problem. He haven't any take action. Even Spinosaurus was led to a great panic. The biggest problem is highlight sequence; at sequence of Giganotosaurus VS Tyrannosaurus, T-rex fall downs by force of Giganotosaurus. Suddenly, Terrineosauruas appears, then stat attack to Giganotosaurus with T-rax. It was awakward for Terrinosaurus to suddenly appear and fight the Giganotosaurus with the Tyrannosaurus, also Tyrannosaurus is a symbol of the serie, and I wondered ""is it okay for described so weakly?""
Extra problem, Dimetrodon is Permian's animal so should have described that why Dimetrodon be restored by Biosin in movie but there was no explanation.<br/><br/>But there alos exists good point, very little: The describes of dinosaurs behavior is natural.<br/><br/>Totally, this movie is aliked Star Wars: Rise of the Skywalker.</div>

Highly recommend and I don't say that lightly.</div>

I was solidly entertained and my boys loved it! Well worth the $60 for admission + $20 for popcorn and a drink + $5 for gas. And Thank God our friends brought ear plugs. Yes, the end is nigh for the big screen. But, this was still good fun mindless entertainment.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've only ever submitted 1 review about a year ago, so where do I start,
1. Plot - convoluted full of gaping holes, even right to the very end. I thought Jurassic park was about dinosaurs not locusts 🤔🤔
2. Characters - no offence to Wanda, but her character was absolutely unnecessary and served absolutelyno purpose, Chris Pratt could've flown an airplane and or helicopter
3. Not one shock scene, unlike the 1st 2 jurassic park movies where good characters whom we care about and didn't expect to get eaten, were shockingly eaten.<br/><br/>4. 1st half was like Jason Bourne
5. 2nd half - Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>6. Ending, they announce that ""all the animals are contained"" in this nature reserve, with no electric fence, wall or even an island to stop them reaching civilisation and 2 minutes later you see them all roaming around the world with other modern species like horses, elephant's.<br/><br/>However, CGI was pretty good, as well as seeing old characters. So 5 stars for all of them.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely loved this movie! Great fun to see with your kids and felt so good to see the original cast again. Lots of tongue-in-cheek references for those of us who know the first ones by heart. Now It's not perfect, but then it isn't meant to be! Watch it for the fun, the action, the magnificent dinosaurs and brilliant chemistry between the cast members. Don't forget the popcorn.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World: Dominion misses its opportunity. The story is needlessly convoluted, sidelining the dinosaurs (and their release) for a mediocre corporate scheme. There are multiple narratives that don't intertwine until the third act. Jokes misfire, plot points are convenient, and motivations are flimsy. Action sequences are messy and unrealistic, defusing their suspense. There are cheesy one-liners, lame fan service attempts, and inept villains. Still, the biggest issue is the missing protagonist or theme. Dominion is overstuffed, with no primary message. Plus, the actors are dull, especially Pratt. Only Goldblum is any fun. Overall, Dominion is emotionally draining and cluttered.<br/><br/>Technically, Dominion is inconsistent. There are abundant animatronics, but the CGI is occasionally goofy. Reuniting the original cast is impressive, but less charming when they're past their primes. The cinematography uses decent lighting, angles, and extended shots. However, the sound coasts off of the originals without adding anything new. There is generic music, impersonal production design, and scattered direction. Tonally, Dominion attempts everything and lands very little. Lastly, the editing is bloated, boring, and unfocused. The film never gains momentum and feels like a chore. Whether it's excessive exposition, contrived drama, or numbing action, Dominion isn't engaging.<br/><br/>Writing: 2/10

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">If you watched this movie, than that probably means that you saw the two prequels, and most likely the original Jurassic Park trilogy. If this is the case, and you still hated this movie, then I have only one question: were your expectations on the appropriate level for this movie?<br/><br/>There is plenty to hate and there is plenty to love too. Out of respect for the director, I gave this movie a 7, because as I saw, he clearly did his best, and attempted to improve on the previous movies. Of course, this didn't always work out...<br/><br/>First, let's see what I thought was missing from the movie, or what I wish was missing. I think by far the biggest mistake the movie makes is that despite all the attempts to refresh the classic JP/JW formula, the movie sticks to most of the same beats from those movies, which really gives it a tired, samey feel. Even though there are some changes, it really is just more of the same most of the time, which could not be portrayed any better, than the obligatory last, big fight at the end. Yes, the fight is spiced up with some new stuff, but overall, it is just the one you've seen in the last movie... or the movie before that, or the movie before that, etc.<br/><br/>Aside from these ""unskippable"" beats, there are a lot of jokes, that fall flat - the film must have had at least 50 jokes in it, and I remember laughing at three of those (I guess there were some chuckles too, but you are not going to the movies for chuckles).<br/><br/>Throughout the movie some characters acted like they were pretty dumb, which took me out of the setting, and lastly, while most of the movie was technically sound, I did have a problem with the pacing here and there. Some scenes took way too long to build up to their climaxes, which weren't even that strong, and this made the movie kind of overstay its welcome.<br/><br/>However, there were also plenty of good things, and I believe a lot of people just hate this movie for never being as good as the original JP trilogy. And while I think that's true, I can also appreciate the JW trilogy as it is - as a different trilogy, that takes place in the same world as JP. This is a more action-packed, less serious trilogy, but on its own it is fine (as far as blockbusters go).<br/><br/>Now, that we accepted it as a different set of movies than the first three, let's see what was good about it!<br/><br/>For one, everything you would expect was just as good, or even better than before. The visual effects, the sound design, the music (although it was too much sometimes, but I actually liked how it was not trying to nostalgia-bait me every second), these were all great. I also think they were at their most creative, when it came to the set pieces, places and action scenes. There was some real variety in here, which I really appreciate, and contrary to what most say, I didn't think they left the set pieces too quickly, because the movie did a great job at showing us (with aerial shots, for example), that they were connected.<br/><br/>Another good thing, that you might not expect, was the characters and their interactions (aside from a new side character, who did nothing but drive and make bad jokes throughout the whole movie, which became boring, fast). The old and new crew all performed very well, and every single one of them had something to do, without it feeling forced, disconnected, or contrived. Well, aside from a certain scene, that didn't really had to happen like that, and most probably was just the way it was for nostalgia. This one scene didn't ruin it all for me though, and I liked how the characters behaved like themselves, without it becoming exhaustingly similar to the previous films, and without them being someone who barely resembles them (looking at you, Star Wars).<br/><br/>Okay, now take a deep breath and bear with me, because what I'm about to say might shock you... I actually liked where they took the story. I know, crazy! But to me it matters a lot, that the story stepped out of the boundaries of being ""just another Jurassic Park episode"". This is one of the things I meant, when I wrote that they did their best to create something that's not just mimicing a popular franchise. And while yes, it had a lot of the same story beats, it was still different enough, that I have to give credit for it. Of course the viewer has to keep in mind, that in the end this IS a new Jurassic World movie, and that there are some boundaries that it simply can not step out of. Still, the story of the girl, made the whole movie a little more personal, than just another ""big dino goes roar"" movie. It's certainly not groundbraking, but I think it added some depth to it, which was mostly missing from the previous two films. This accompanied with the good acting, fun character interactions and great sets, action and visuals, made for a very enjoyable experience for me.<br/><br/>In short, my takeaway is that if you go into this movie with the right expectations, you can have a good time. This is not Jurassic Park, this is Jurassic World. It's bigger, prettier, shallow, but can be just as fun. It has several shortcomings, but this movie (not the previous ones) makes up for it with some extra care and creativity, which ultimately helps it become the best of the three JW movies. It's not great, but certainly a very enjoyable, slightly better than average blockbuster popcorn movie - but only if YOU allow it to be.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just saw Jurrasic World 🌍 Dominian. I can put up with average acting but I cannot put up with TERRIBLE ideas and an atrocious script. Coming out of the last movie lthey had a ready made set up with Dinosaurs out in the real World and they completely stuffed up an amazing opportunity. Hopeless. Oh and they threw in enough 'woke' moments to keep those people happy and the rest of us shaking our heads.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Other reviewers went into great detail about everything wrong with this film, so I'll just keep it short. This film is uninspired and just retreads everything we've seen in previous Jurassic movies, without having any of the interesting elements that made the original what it was. There are two main flaws:
1) The main villain is incredibly boring and one dimensionally evil.<br/><br/>2) we were promised that this movie would show us a world where Dinos have essentially integrated into the modern world. Although the opening montage showcases some of this, after the main character intros are done the plot brings us back to another secluded Dino zone so we can relive all the scenes from Jurassic Park. However, none of the tension or suspense is there, except for one scene . I think only one named character actually gets killed by Dinos (which we don't actually see) making it far less scary than the original, where named characters are picked off one by one.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this to parents of kids who want to see big dinosaurs on the big screen and don't care if the human characters are interesting. But for all other movie goers, save your money.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Wow, foiled again, a movie from my youth gets a long awaited follow up, it has a great cast, with some familiar faces, a big budget, so there's action galore, and some wonderful music, but a plot..... a plot that could have been written by a random stranger walking past the studio.<br/><br/>How on Earth is it possible for such a film to feel so vacuous, so empty, this film made me feel nothing, other than boredom. £40 that could have been used on so many other things.<br/><br/>It's not ok these days to simply try and dazzle us with some awesome visuals, there needs to be some sort of plot, but there just isn't one, in simplistic terms it asks if man can live with dinosaurs, but of course you know what's going to happen. Some of the visuals are great, epic, some scenes though....did they run out of time?<br/><br/>Chris Pratt, didn't do it for me, the old cast tried, but it felt hollow.<br/><br/>Like the dinosaurs themselves, this franchise should have been left in the past. 3/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The reunion of characters and iconic scenes can warm the heart of any Jurassic Park fan, however outside of those moments, the story fails to stand on its own. It seems the direction of the film is often sidetracked by implementing these nostalgic moments, even some iconic dinosaurs were merely reduced to memories of better scenes in the past.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love the Jurassic Parc franchise, but there has never been much of a plot, except people screaming and running away from those CGI animals.<br/><br/>The last installment is the same formula. They tried to put some disturbing plot into play, but it hadn't much of a use. For me it's all about the suspense/action parts, and some of the scenes were all bit the same thing I have seen before. I think the best action sequence was the scene in Malta. Well edited and amazing camera work. I loved DeWanda Wise, she gave a lot of flair to her performance. Absolutely loved to see the original 3 have a big part in the movie (Laura Dern cracks me up!). And Bryce Dallas Howard always puts on a great, scary performance. Plus points for the cast for sure.<br/><br/>I absolutely enjoyed myself for 2h30, but it won't be my favourite one of the full installment. Still more than recommend to watch this at the cinema!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Never underestimate Hollywood's ability to take something phenomenal and cherished and suck the life out of it for money. The dinosaurs felt more like window dressing than the focus. Disjointed, impossible to keep up with or care about the myriad of story lines. Actually walked out with 30 minutes left because the ending is just a conclusion to a ridiculous dumpster fire.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">To paraphrase the great Dr. Ian Malcolm: they were so concerned with whether they could make five Jurassic Park sequels that they didn't think about whether they should make five Jurassic Park sequels. What a piece of junk the latest one is!! It's plodding and predictable. It offers nothing new, just supposed ""homages"" and Easter eggs. Thankfully I have Regal Unlimited! Two hours and twenty six minutes long and it felt like four hours!! Sam Neill doesn't seem to realize he's supposed to be playing the same character that he did in the original. Chris Pratt is more annoying by the second. I sincerely hope that his MCU role is almost at an end. Didn't Bryce Dallas Howard have a promising career at one point? And she and Laura Dern's Ellie Sadler are total badasses! Until they have to walk over some bugs,...then the shrieking begins. What crap! What tripe! What an utter waste of time!!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Chris Pratt is definitely the right guy to lead these movies. His charisma and charm fit exactly what a Jurassic movie should have. The dinosaurs are cool and all but the Kayla girl was frankly only added to this movie to play the typical ""strong women of color"" role. She adds nothing to the story except being good at everything. Typical lazy insert character from Hollywood. Nice to see the legacy characters return. Cheesy generic messy? Sure. But also pretty fun and a good time at the movies.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I really enjoyed how Jurassic World: Dominion tied both Park and World together and how they wrapped up the story-lines introduced in the first two World movies. I must add you don't<br/><br/>have to have seen all theses films in the cannon ;Jurassic World: Dominion stands on it own with tremendous Creature Feature effects . The movie's visual effects and other technical elements are high-quality, with excellent sound design and another on-point soundtrack that incorporates John Williams' original theme.<br/><br/>Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, dinosaurs now live and hunt alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.<br/><br/>It was an extremely fun summer Block Buster 165 million dollar budget with very high production value leading edge CGI FX with top notch animatronics (thank you Jaws and E. T. for pioneering !). The dinosaurs/prehistoric creatures/flying reptiles were the stars . Dominion has some great creature feature moments. The story unites Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the newer films with scientists Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), and Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) from the original movies. Together they must fight the villainous CEO of an international genetics/agricultural corporation who's lying about how the company uses dinosaur DNA. Expect plenty of jump scares, human-eating dinosaurs, and epic predator-on-predator fights with generous nostalgic nods all over the place. The original trio of actors who made the original Jurassic Park memorable, Dern, Neill, and Goldblum add much gravitas to Jurassic World Dominion, portraying characters who are committed to saving the world with generous nostalgic nods all over the place. This is a fun and exciting finale to the JP franchise. I can not wait to own this one on Blu-ray.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The end of the Jurassic Saga, or at least until the evil company Universal ressurects it again for profit.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, this movie in unrelenting, a very fast paced octane feature wich gives no rest to the viewer, a lot of that due to the Plot been very small. So yeah, there is that, the plot is thin, non the less, it doesn´t need a big Plot, the history of the charachters really goes a long way, a concept that in this movie works really well. This movie did a great job with the action scenes and the dinamics in the film are so fast that truly evoques the golden times of adventure movies.<br/><br/>This movie has beautiful cinematography too, really good sound mixing and thankfully in this entry they didn´t try to over do the music like in past films so it made for some good atmosphere through the movie.<br/><br/>Acting was spot on by the cast of JP, Neil, Goldblum and Dern will live as some really good actors while the new charachters of Dallas, Pratt and the girl did a solid job, this movie did not relly on them and that is a good thing cause they can play to their strenghts in the actions sequences.<br/><br/>Still there is a couple of lows in the movie, it capitalizes on nostalgia big time, something sometimes feels a bit out of place; it moves a couple of charachters out of the way since they are not important to the plot and there was a big premise delivered through the pomotional material that did not live up to the hype.<br/><br/>However i feel like this movie is truly better than the past two, this one been far better paced and far faster than the other two, a lot like Mad Max in that sense, at the end is unrelenting start to finish with a thin plot, beat that.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The best way to sum up the entire movie is basically, that they took all the Jurassic Park movies that have ever been made and snipped all the best parts from them and stuffed it into this one. Now this doesn't mean that taking the best parts is going to make a good movie. Unfortunately, it was sad to see the screen writers had no imagination.<br/><br/>We have the original main actors from the first movie with the new actors to attract fans,
We have the typical kid that needs to be watched out for,
The same genius Dr. Henry Wu that has almost been in every movie,
The one baby dinosaur that needs to be saved just like in Jurassic Park 2,
A bad corporation wanting to profit (Jurassic Park 2),
A plane crash just like in Jurassic Park 3,
A scary dinosaur chasing them around,
We have the iconic Chris Pratt riding the motorcycle again,
The main villain being killed just like Dennis in the first movie,
The T. Rex fighting another carnivore dinosaur at the end of the movie
with the famous roar once again.<br/><br/>There is nothing that was original in the movie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I mean where to begin. How could this be so disappointing? For one, it's boring. I didn't think that anyone was in any danger at any moment.<br/><br/>Second, I was hoping that this movie wouldn't pull things from the original and redo it in this movie but I was proven wrong. Elle taking her sunglasses off dramatically, oh wow that is from the first movie that was so great. Ian trying to distract a dinosaur with fire this time not a flare like the original. Heck, the t-Rex walked behind this circle thing to make it look just like the Jurassic world logo. How original!!<br/><br/>I wanted to like this, I really did. I'm just debating if it's this or Jurassic park 3 as the worst movie in the franchise.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The movie has some good points but is also underwhelming in a lot of others. It was amazing seeing the original cast come back to this film, but it felt like some other things returned from the original jurassic park. There were multiple times this movie where it felt like it was nabbed straight from the original jurassic park, which felt more like lazy writing which did not really do the movie any good.<br/><br/>The plot in short was not too good, there were a lot of 'but why?' moments, but then who really goes to a jurassic park/world movie for the amazing plot. The main attraction is, of course, the dinosaurs. The CGI on the dinosaurs was really well done and the action scenes are a thrill to watch! But it does feel like, after five movies, the 'magic' of seeing these dinosaurs on screen is a bit gone. Especially when there is not a big bad evil dinosaur this movie focusses on, like there was in the other jurassic world movies (indominus rex and indoraptor).<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was fine, but not outstanding and the plot was, as mentioned, okay at best. The great action scenes and the beautiful scenery and cgi make up for that a bit, though, and I'd say the movie is fun to watch.</div>

With an incredibly captivating premise, Colin Trevorrow ignores the fascinating years of mankind trying to deal with the chaos of dinosaurs repopulating Earth, opting instead to write a generic, formulaic, surprisingly tedious screenplay.<br/><br/>In addition to the lousy character treatment, the cast is divided into two storylines focused on nonsensical, bland rescue and espionage missions, placing dinosaurs on the back burner during the excessively long runtime.<br/><br/>Action sequences reach drastically low entertainment levels, sometimes imperceptible due to erratic camera work and choppy editing.<br/><br/>The cast, visuals, and score might save this from being a complete trainwreck, but not from miserably failing to deliver an epic conclusion to a saga that deserved nothing less than that.""<br/><br/>Rating: D.</div>

</div>
<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The Jurassic Park franchise goes out with a wet fart in Jurassic World: Dominion -- an absolute zombie of a film that encapsulates a great deal of what's wrong with Hollywood today. To quote Metaplex writer Brendan Hodges, regarding the less than stellar Tomato scores of the most recent Jurassic films: ""In retrospect, it's nuts how many times people have f-cked up the surefire premise of dinosaur chomp-chomp human"".<br/><br/>In a last-ditch effort to breathe any sort of life back into the series, Universal (well aware of how little we care about the Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard characters) has brought back the actors that were there from the start -- Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum -- to bait our nostalgia. And yet, this somehow makes the movie seem all the more piteous. These particular Member Berries turned to raisins a long time ago; we're only reminded how old and tired this all is. (I won't call them ""dinosaurs"", though. That's too mean and too obvious.)<br/><br/>This doesn't feel like ""a look back at everything we've been through"", à la last year's Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's more akin to snatching Indiana Jones from the nursing home for a final adventure or having James Earle Jones record just a few more Darth Vader or Mufasa lines from his death bed.<br/><br/>The plot... Well, what can I say? It's largely the same old spiel with the obligatory new touch -- of which each sequel needs to have at least one (e.g. The park actually being open in Jurassic World). The ""twist"" or whatever this time around is that the dinosaurs have actually started fully co-existing with humans (going on hunts with us and various other stuff that's ""supposed"" to be silly, u guize), while the real threat is a type of locust that has begun eradicating the totality of the Earth's food supply.<br/><br/>Even so, the formula is largely unaltered. The dinosaurs still have a remote location all their own, albeit with human allies close by, and are only unleashed once the formula permits it. Another mandatory detail is the human villain. This time around it's the greedy CEO of Biosyn Inc., who orchestrated the creation of the locusts to destroy the supplies of rival companies (these particular grasshoppers have been engineered to avoid whichever crops are property of Biosyn). I dunno, man. I can't even laugh at this stuff anymore.<br/><br/>The only real joy I felt during this picture -- however ""ironic"" it may really have been -- was during the first few minutes where Goldblum was at his most Goldblum. Other than that, there is no reason for you to pick this film over this other movie that came out this weekend, crafted by the VFX supervisor on the first-ever Jurassic Park, Phil Tippett, over the course of 30 years. It's called Mad God and reportedly rivals even the new Cronenberg joint in terms of nastiness. I understand if that doesn't sound too attractive but I'd rather see something that makes me feel sick than something that makes me feel nothing.<br/><br/>Hell, even if you really, really feel that you need to see CG dinosaurs doing CG dinosaur things, Jon Favreau's Prehistoric Planet (putting his 2019 Lion King technology to more appropriate use) is a far better pick than this (not only because watching it doesn't require you to leave your sofa). We've come an incomprehensibly long way since 1925's The Lost World and even D. W. Griffith's 1914 short film Brute Force. There are ways to celebrate this that don't involve sitting through a Chris Pratt performance.<br/><br/>Long story short: Yes, despite Colin Trevorrow's promises that the latest big new dinosaur -- unironically called a ""Giga"" -- would be like a dinosaur version of The Joker, Dominion still turned out to be a pretty cringe movie. I know, I'm shocked too.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">While I, like the majority of film lovers, absolutely love the original Jurassic Park, I've basically felt like I've given the majority of the franchise pass, rather than genuinely believing they're great films. The only other film I genuinely think is a solid entry is the first Jurassic World (which in itself isn't original at all). I've felt that the sense of awe and wonder has been missing since the original film and with the release of the ""final"" installment with Jurassic World Dominion, I was eager to see how they would put a bow on the franchise at least. Sadly, I have to be honest and say this is probably my least favourite of the entire franchise. Let's dive into why I think fans should still see this movie, but with incredibly lowered expectations.<br/><br/>Picking up about four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, dinosaurs are now free in our world and living amongst humans and other species. From here, there are multiple storylines that pick up that are not explored in the marketing for this film, so I'll keep it brief. Maisie Lockwood, the young girl from the previous film has been living with Owen and Claire in protective custody, but she is kidnapped and a rescue mission for her begins. Not only that, but the offspring of Owen's companion Blue is also with her. We then meet the original cast, who are on their own mission. Eventually, these two missions collide, but overall, I think this entire film was a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>I felt as though this film spent next to zero time explaining what happened in between the events of the previous film and this final installment. This isn't even me getting my hopes up, because we've already seen dinosaurs on land before, so I truly believe a portion of this film should've been dedicated to people trying to survive or figuring out how to. With that said, there are still many unique ideas presented here that I thought were clever story developments, but I also found that the film failed to deliver on them, especially since they didn't work for a Jurassic Park film. That's also one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to massive franchises. When you present cool ideas, but they don't actually work in the context of the franchise, that just feels wildly disappointing.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, I'm a fan of Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum, so seeing them, all come together here was a lot of fun and some of their banter got some genuine laughs out of me. With that said, I actually believe newcomer DeWanda Wise as Kayla was the biggest standout here. Her witty dialogue and back and forth with Pratt throughout a lot of the film was terrific and I will gladly watch her performances in the future. It's always nice to have a new character added to a franchise that surprises you. If for nothing else, this was a great cast of characters to see together.<br/><br/>Now for the dinosaurs, which were severely lacking in this film. This franchise, even in its weaker installments, has never had a shortage of Dinosaur action. Yes, this film has plenty of action involving Dinosaurs, some of which are genuinely fun, but I have to admit that the core story of this film really came out of left field for me, and not in a good way. I'm not about to dive into the details, because these details aren't even explored in the marketing, but I'll say that the main storyline focuses very little on Dinosaurs. For the end of a Dinosaur franchise, this rubbed me the wrong way. I couldn't comprehend why this story element was even being explored. It was basically what made me dislike this film overall, even though I enjoyed moments of it.<br/><br/>In the end, Jurassic World Dominion isn't going to gain any new fans for the franchise, but at least the entire cast is here, having a good time, and it shows. I was excited to see Colin Trevorrow returning to direct, after working on the first Jurassic World, but even his touch didn't work here. The score didn't stand out to me either and the climax was very forgettable, especially being the ""finale"" of a franchise. I wish I had more positive things to say about a franchise that I have enjoyed until this point, but I honestly don't. Jurrasic Park fans will absolutely get a kick out of certain scenes so I recommend that fans still see it, but as a movie on its own, it's just not good.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World: Dominion is a bit of a frustrating movie as all the parts are there to make a potentially great film. Dinosaurs let loose on the world and returning fan favourite characters from the OG trilogy should be a slam dunk, but the result is an overcrowded and sprawling film that lacks focus and originality.<br/><br/>There are positives with this film. Some scenes were incredibly tense and well executed. A jungle scene with Bryce and a scene on an icy river were very well done I thought, but sequences like this were too few and far between.<br/><br/>The inclusion of the legacy characters (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern) was a nice touch, particularly Goldblum who had some incredibly tongue in cheek but satisfying one liners. I do think though that the inclusion of these characters over saturated the story a bit, and perhaps they could have been confined to smaller roles as there were just too many characters and plot threads crammed into the film.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen a more meaty role for Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire. I feel like she's been let down by the franchise a bit and could have grown into a more layered character.<br/><br/>Most frustratingly though, 3 films into the franchise now and I am very tired of Chris Pratt controlling dinosaurs with his hand. This really isn't as cool as the director seems to think. I also resent the fact that we were fed another sequence where Pratt is chased by raptors while on a motorbike. All the possible dinosaurs, all the potential set pieces, and we are fed the exact same thing from the two previous movies...<br/><br/>The dialogue is also very poor. Full of clunky exposition and goofy one liners that didn't land at all. A bit of a mess from a writing perspective.<br/><br/>I think the word clunky sums up this movie pretty well actually. Too many characters, messy dialogue, a tad too long, glimpses of cool dinosaur action but not enough of it. There's fun to be had with this film but for the most part it is a bit of a let down.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">People who've been following the Jurassic movies since childhood would find the script a blunder which was garnished with poor direction... Same old chasing scenes and dino encounters repeated. Ends the same way as previous ones.. Dino fights dino and the humans rush to their plane. Missed creative vision.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">'Jurassic World Dominion' (or Jurassic Park 6) is the presumed end of this second trilogy. It primarily follows Owen (Pratt), Claire (Howard) &amp; their adopted daughter Maisie (Sermon), as she's hunted/kidnapped by bad guys that think she's a clone. Then they throw in the original team of Ellie (Dern), Alan (Neill, struggling to find his accent from the original film) and Ian (Goldblum) who are working to bring down Biosyn Corp and their GE locusts, led by Dodgson (Scott). They have help from Kayla (Wise), Ramsay (Athie) and Barry (Sy), and BD Wong is also back as Dr Wu.<br/><br/>While the premise of dinosaurs roaming wild is an interesting concept, it's not fully explored and only hinted at in parts. Where it is shown, such as Owen wrangling the Parasaurolophus, there's more questions as to the potential realness of it, i.e. Reptiles living in the snow, horses being as fast as them, their calmness. There's a lot of ""really?!"" moments in this film. There's some funny moments and some good action scenes, but it all seems to have too many chefs and lack focus/seems rushed.<br/><br/>This is nowhere near the quality of the original film - probably slightly better than 'Jurassic Park III' and 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom', not that that means much. Oddly, while we see a few dinosaurs, including some new ones, but mostly the tried &amp; tested favourites - there seems to be not that many scenes where dinosaurs are the main focus. While not horribly slow, it doesn't feel like it all comes together and starts working until the final 40min, which isn't much of the 2 hour 20min running time.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">One quick note before content review if you are thinking of going to see it in theaters. This movie is LOUD! Sound seemed to almost double once trailers ended and the movie started. At first, I thought it was because I hadn't been to theaters in a while but, everyone was saying the same thing as we were leaving. It felt like we just left an artillery range. They spent so much money on the earth trembles they want you to feel that they just crank the sound effects. YIKES!<br/><br/>Now for content. Man, this was really disappointing. I didn't care for Fallen Kingdom but, I thought the premise that it set up for this movie seemed intriguing. It ended up really surprising me.....just not in a good way.<br/><br/>I thought this had such potential to be the most unique sequel yet. Dinosaur roaming the earth? I figured they would lean in to Jeff Goldblum's ""Life...has way"" tag line (which they so heavily feature in trailers) to make it so dinosaurs started reproducing. Would we see an end of days scenario? Co-Existence? Not so much.<br/><br/>They leaned HEAVILY into nostalgia. Which was kind of cool but, definitely can feel like the same story when....ya know....everything is the same.<br/><br/>I don't consider this a spoiler since if is highly mentioned and reviewed but, man. The big bad threat being cross-engineered locusts instead of dinosaurs is legit the biggest let-down.<br/><br/>I still like Pratt and it was cool seeing the original cast but, essentially everything outside of that felt like a major miss.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World was a poor remake of the original Jurassic Park. Fallen Kingdom was some nightmarish combination of Lost World 2.0 and cobbled-together ideas from the failed franchise refresh in the early 2010s. They at least felt like JP movies. This feels like a straight-to-Netflix globe-trotting spy flick with a dinosaur paint job.<br/><br/>This film is riddled with glaring ethical issues, more so than any other film in the franchise. The loss of life and property resulting from allowing these dinosaurs to roam the world is massive. We're supposed to just be ok with Owen and Claire kidnapping a child who surely has next of kin looking for her. A massive corporation re-kidnaps that kid instead of just stealing her hairbrush for some DNA samples. We're supposed to rejoice over predators (the trained atrocaraptors and the giga) being slaughtered for natural/trained behaviors.<br/><br/>If your kids were a big fan of the ""hero"" dinosaurs in the previous films (Rexy and Blue), prepare to see them for about 5 combined minutes of screentime. They're barely in this movie. Blue's child, Beta, has 0 reason to be in the movie and could have been written out entirely. She's not even cute for selling toys so I don't see the point.<br/><br/>The original cast is dragged back into the fray for nostalgia-bait. Although their plotline (sneaking into Biosyn to gather evidence that they're releasing genetically-engineered locusts into the world to slash agricultural competition) has absolutely nothing to do with dinosaurs or JP, it was far more enjoyable than seeing Owen and Claire run a gauntlet of pointless, barely-connected action setpieces on their quest to re-re-kidnap a kid.<br/><br/>Biosyn's motivations are baffling. Won't even bother trying to unravel that.<br/><br/>The promotion for this movie crowed about using practical effects, but the puppets and animatronics are legitimately worse than what we saw in the original JP. The CGI is passable but nothing all that impressive.<br/><br/>The only positives in this movie are that there are some cool action setpieces and FINALLY we get to see some weird variety in the dinosaurs. Therizinosaurus, some feathered dinos, more variety in smaller dinos.<br/><br/>Kids will like it but I'm just glad that this disrespectful travesty of a trilogy is over.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have been a Jurassic fan since the beginning. Initially, just to see the dinosaurs in an almost lifelike environment and the animals themselves was unbelievable in a pleasant and welcome surprise. Although the stories have changed with the movies the basic core of Jurassic World is what lives on with the actors cementing the films. Jurassic World Dominion is the best of the bunch!! Replete with the original actors and introducing new top-notch talent just enhances the already blockbuster.saga. A Fantastic storyline with some twists and turns that you will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. I recommend this movie to the entire family it is up to you how young you can take your children because there is some violence. After all this time, Jurassic World Dominion is the best movie of the bunch! 😎</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is the perfect film for 4DX. Full of nostalgia too. Any Jurassic fan can enjoy this installment if you just go with an open mind and not nitpicking the script.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had to go to see this movie, there was not a chance to don't wacht the end of a franchise that started when I was 13. I new that the movie wouldn't be great, but I also expected a good story.<br/><br/>The plot is like a bad joke, to literaly connected to what is going on nowdays with the food supply chain and big corporations.<br/><br/>The characters are really silly sometimes, even the main antagonist seem like a bad copy of Dr. No mixed with Steve Jobs. The tokens of the movie are answering too an obvious check list to fulfull politically correct regulations.<br/><br/>It's such a pity that Speilberg legacy go down the toilet so easily...</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Four years after the destruction of Isla Nubar, the dinosaurs now live and hunt alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share history's fearsome creatures.<br/><br/>This movie's so cool, bringing back the original characters from the Jurassic Park movies was a great move and I loved it. Seeing the original actors reprise their roles as Ellie Satter, Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm was heartwarming. The dinosaurs were obviously great as always and I enjoyed that there weren't any hybrid dinosaurs. Seeing old classics return as well as our beloved T-Rex and the Raptors are satisfying. Even newer dinosaurs such as the carnivorous dinosaur Giganotosaurus was neat, even though the dinosaur looked to be the same size as the Tyrannosaurus Rex. They even brought the other classics like the Apatosaurus, Trieceratops, Carnotaurus, Igunodons, Parasurolophus, Allosaurus and a few others.<br/><br/>Was it perfect? No. Was it fun? Absolutely! There will be a lot of things people will pick apart this movie for. I for one didn't mind it. It was a solid chapter to the Jurassic World trilogy. It was a nice balance with the newer stars and the OG's. And if you're planning to go to see this movie, I wouldn't rise your expectations because we know that no Jurassic Park film will ever top the original, but see it if you want to see your favorite characters again as well as the creatures. It goes to show you that life continues to find a way even if all things would come to an end.<br/><br/>7.5/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">There's nothing like what those former Jurassic Park sequels. Just hope this is the last. So hollow and pointless. So boring because there's no essence in this movie that's interesting enough to hold our attention. Is put up one hand with palm forward the only way to hold off the dinosaurs, a hand gesture these wild vicious creatures would recognize and start thinking ""Hmm, that's an universal traditional friendly STOP sign so popularly accepted by our species not to attack?"" ""Are these human traffic cops trying to direct our movements?"" ""No Right Turn on RED?"" This is one of the most boring movies so far in 2022.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The end of fallen kingdom offered an interesting premise to the concluding chapter of the new Jurassic Park trilogy ( an unnecessary trilogy in my opinion) but I thought the direction offered some hope. Sadly not.<br/><br/>It was like they forgot the ending of fallen kingdom and instead opted for a complete rehash of Jurassic Park 1 and 2. The plot was meh, the scripting was dire, the wokeness cribgeworthy.<br/><br/>In the 1st Jurassic Park movies (chiefly 1 and 2) they were more like psychological horror movies with dinosaurs. The dinosaurs were genuinely petrifying, the T really and velociraptors gave me nightmares. They were pure killers devoid of emotion. They did not have human traits attached to them and the SFX brought a real sense of realism to the movie.<br/><br/>In the new trilogy we see too much of the dinosaurs, they've been given a friendly persona and had humanistic qualities attached to them, and instead of we need to get put of here and leave them alone, we now have this sense of hippy we must protect them at all costs compassion for them. It's ruined the whole ethos of lore of the originals.<br/><br/>To sum it up it was aterrovle movie, I just wanted to get up and walk out and would of had I not paid a lot of money to see it in IMAX, don't allow yourself to get ripped of as I did. Stay well away.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">First of all, it reunites the cast of the original film with the younger stars of the preceding two films. Letting us, the movie-goers, find out what's happened to them.<br/><br/>Ellie Sattler is now an ex-wife with an empty nest (both kids in college). Dr. Alan Grant is still a bachelor; having chosen to bury himself (no pun intended) in his old line of work rather than try to find someone who can hold a candle to Ellie as a love interest. And Ian Malcolm has seemingly become a corporate stooge for BioSyn; InGen's one-time competitor. But, now the dominant power in genetic engineering.<br/><br/>As for Owen and Claire, they've spent the four years since the destruction of Isla Nublar as the guardians of Maisie Lockwood. It's what you might call an informal adoption as evidenced by the fact she still uses her original surname. Rather than going by the hyphenating of ""Deering"" and ""Grady!""<br/><br/>Of course, the true stars of the picture are the dino-clones and all the other CGI creatures. New ones introduced in this sequel are the feathered Pyroraptor; the long-clawed Therizinisaurus; and the sailfin-backed Dimetrodons. But, the creatures with the biggest ""Ewwww!"" factor are undeniably those genetically engineered locusts. From their size, I'd have to guess that they were spliced with DNA from one of those five foot-long prehistoric dragonflies!<br/><br/>How the various subplots converge to bring the central characters together is something you'll have to go and see for yourselves. But, trust me; it'll be worth sitting through the nearly three hour running time. Especially the seamlessly edited-together montage just before the ending credits!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't know where to start, but everything about this movie is actually bad! All the dialogs are out of place! It's full of forced quotes from the previous movies! All the performances are very very awful, even the original cast acted so bad (and we're talking about people like Laura Dern, Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum). The plot it's so dumb and occasionally nosense! Also photography, directing, visual effects and editing are very low tier if we think about the franchise and the budget!!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I don't know where to start. The graphics were good, the sets exciting, the dinosaurs plentiful. But the good ends there. The actual movie; the dialogue was laughable, it was like they used the first draft and didn't revise or put thought into anything spoken in this movie, the plot was cheap and overly convenient, the sequence of events didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>For example, two people are hanging onto a platform while a dinosaur tears and tosses it around and the characters are sliding down and losing grip and just before the dinosaur tears it off along with the characters thankfully there's a cut right then and next you see the characters jumping to the safety of the room conveniently.<br/><br/>Another scene when one character lands in a parachute in the jungle and another set of characters land on a lake across the jungle. Literally miles and miles away. And it the next scene the set of characters just happens to walk upon the sight of where the parachute landed. You're telling me that they, not having the slightest idea where this person could have landed, just happened to traverse miles upon miles through a dense and dinosaur filled forest and come across the exact location of their lost friend. How pathetically convenient. This is one of dozens of examples of how ridiculous this entire film was. I'm offended that the production team thinks I am as stupid as that.<br/><br/>Other than that I am at a loss for words. What a horrible way to ruin this trilogy. Hopefully the next reboot will be better, but let's let this movie air out for a few years before we try to get back into this universe.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's interesting how most of the 1 star reviews are very short, this says a lot, basically that we don't want this film to take up anymore time we wasted watching it.<br/><br/>This movie is made for the late fans of jurassic park, the original movie has far more impact, the original movie has only 7% dino screen time where this film has about 80% dino screen time which kills everything about what jurassic park set out to do.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie is how much the director tries to tie in scenes and recreate scenarios and legendary moments from the original film. Spielberg did this because he is a fantastic filmmaker, this director did this to please fans. Nothing comes good from people pleasing in any situation in life.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">While I don't find this bad. It is certainly disappointing. Really its not even a Jurassic Park/World movie its more of a Jurassic Locust movie. They side lined the dinosaurs heavily. And I got no idea why. The older characters coming back was neat and seeing them all together was fun but without the plot having anything to do with dinosaurs. It feels wrong. Also the clone is stupid. The entire plot regarding the clone is dumb. I can accept stupidity in a movie series like this but a clone? Really? Bare in mind when they include the dinosaurs, they go back to the previous films plot with dinosaurs being sold as weapons and having red dots trigger a reaction for dinosaurs to attack you. That was a plot that should have stayed in the second film, it was a horrible plot then and it still is now. Overall its a film with horrible ideas, plots, and story telling. But there is enough fun to keep me interested, I was never bored. And seeing all the characters was fun. But man this was a huge disappointment.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I'm a huge Jurassic park fan. I have watched the original movie over 400 times. I also liked lost world and Jurassic world. The rest were average at best.<br/><br/>Dominion is near the bottom of that list unfortunately. The plot is downright idiotic and all the main characters have plot armour. The fights between the dinosaurs were among the worst I've ever seen. Seriously, who decided that ending fight should play out that way? I was shaking my head in disbelief.<br/><br/>The only good thing about the movie was seeing the original cast together again. But the plot doesn't do them any favours.<br/><br/>Every scene fumbles onto the next with dinosaurs doing exactly what's required for plot convenience even when it makes absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>This is a popcorn movie through and through. Leave your brain at the door and you might be entertained. Keep your expectations low.</div>

I really regret watching this. Just a terrible movie. Shame on whoever made this for just making money off the franchise, off the name of previous actors and throwing in a bunch of dinosaurs. At least respect your audience. This is a slap in the face. Just a terrible movie. Now, I'm going to walk out.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Friends, if you want to see a good movie with action, suspense, Sci-fi Jurassic World is a movie that deserves and must be seen!<br/><br/>Chris Pratt one of my favorite actors plays Owen does a very good job in the movie!<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard a very good and beautiful actress, and a very important thing can run on heels;)
I don't know how to say but I swear that at some stages I was like I was there and when Indominus-Rex was around I was standing still, and I realized this only after the movie was over :)
The scene when Indominus-Rex fights Tyrannosaurus (T-Rex) and teams up with raptors (Blue) to defeat Indominus-Rex!<br/><br/>I'm really sorry about the Raptor Pack
I really liked Blue, Echo, Delta and Charlie they really seemed to have their own personality!<br/><br/>And the scene when they find out the plain with the dead Apatosaurus really saddened me :(
I won't say more just that the movie is great and you have to watch it whether you are a fan of dinosaurs or not!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">It began in 1990 as a speculative science fiction novel by Michael Crichton about genetically engineered dinosaurs on an isolated island off the coast of Central America. And then in 1993, director Steven Spielberg turned it into a genuinely great and scary sci-fi/suspense thriller. Thus was born JURASSIC PARK. Two sequels-1997's THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (directed by Spielberg), and 2001's JURASSIC PARK 3 (directed by Joe Johnston)-came about, followed by a fourteen-year break. Then in 2015, with Spielberg serving as executive producer but not directing, there came JURASSIC WORLD, directed by Colin Treverrow, followed in 2018 by JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM (directed by J. A. Bayona) in 2018. And in 2022, we have come to what is likely the conclusion of this mega-successful dinosaur franchise, in the form of JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION, with Trevorrow back in the director's chair.<br/><br/>At the end of JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM, a combination of an exploding volcano on Isla Nublar and the usual corporate avarice had allowed the dinosaurs and all manner of genetically engineered prehistoric creatures to break free. As JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION stars, therefore, humans and dinosaurs (and their offspring, needless to say) are co-existing together, with extremely chaotic results, including a plague of what are basically dino-locusts wiping out the world's grain supply. Dern and Neill return as the intrepid pair of paleontologists Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant to find out that those locusts are being fueled via a genetically-modified seed invented by the Biosyn corporation, run by one Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who seems very much a Steve Jobs type, but with megalomaniacal ambitions that could spell humanity's downfall. Pratt (as Owen Grady) and Howard (as Claire Dearing) are back to join in the race to stop Scott dead in his tracks; and they have a secret weapon of sorts in their adapted daughter (Sermon), who, in an interesting twist of a back story, is the granddaughter of John Hammond, the man responsible for this unleashing of genetic dinosaurs in the first place, and who also has a few dino genes inside her DNA as well. All of them converge at Biosyn's isolated mountain facility in northern Italy where, along with famous chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), whom Scott has basically bribed up to this point, confront Scott and his off-the-wall ambitions; and what ensues is, of course, hair-raising dinosaur terror on an industrial, if not indeed downright apocalyptic scale.<br/><br/>With a length of close to two and a half hours, JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION is obviously the longest of the entire six-film franchise, and, without too much doubt, in many places the most off-the-wall entry as well, mostly due to Scott's kidnapping plot involving Sermon, which contains chases on motorbikes, vans, and planes that wouldn't be out of place in any James Bond film, but arguably are here. As with the previous three films of the Jurassic Park/Jurassic World franchise, Spielberg functions as an executive producer only (having gotten himself in two major directorial undertakings of his own, WEST SIDE STORY and THE FABELMANS), so it is up to Trevorrow to come up with something huge. And this is indeed what happens in JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION. The dinosaurs, particularly the locusts, are more ferocious than they have ever been before, ensuring that the franchise end (if indeed it does end here) on an almost end-of-the-world scale. But to Trevorrow's credit, probably with Spielberg's encouragement, he had the good sense to bring Dern, Neill, and Goldblum back from the original 1993 classic, and combine them with Pratt and Howard, who are (thankfully) no longer a bickering couple as they were in the first two JURASSIC WORLD films, but responsible dinosaur behavioral experts also looking out for Sermon's welfare amidst all the violent, screaming dinosaur terror.<br/><br/>Trevorrow is obviously not the subtlest of directors to begin with (sometimes, even Spielberg isn't either {witness ""1941""]), but when it comes to JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION, he delivers the goods without turning towards the way-over-the-top implausibilities of a Michael Bay (the infernal ""Transformers"" series) or Roland Emmerich (his admittedly good 2009 end-of-the-world opus ""2012""); and the six principal actors of the franchise keep much of everything else on an even keel.<br/><br/>If this is indeed the end of this dinosaur franchise, it is one hell of a way to go out on. And this is why I'm giving JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION an '8' rating.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think everything that has culminated in the Jurassic film series since the early 90s has really left an impression for the past and present generation.<br/><br/>Four years have passed since Isla Nublar faced a violent volcanic eruption along with the Lockwood Manor incident, so Owen, Claire, and adoptive daughter Maisie have moved on to accept our modern day lives are now shared with living, breathing dinosaurs. Many familiar, but also uncovering new, dangerous species never seen before. However, Earth's ecosystem and balance are greatly affected by their presence that it also brought the attention of doctors Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcolm to step forward, join forces with Owen and his group, and stop these new threats.<br/><br/>While I was overly excited to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum reunited since the first Jurassic Park movie, I was really hoping there was going to be a solid story to conclude the Jurassic World trilogy. Unfortunately, the story was so-so to me and that's about it. Although it improves over its slow-paced predecessor Fallen Kingdom, director Colin Trevorrow's follow-up Dominion falls short as a whole. He succeeded in 2015 with Jurassic World, but I was expecting more could be addressed on what throws these characters into conflict. Using genetically-altered locusts and velociraptor Blue's offspring Beta as plot devices sounds interesting, but feels kind of lacking in execution.<br/><br/>This film will never reach landmark status as the 1993 original that will forever remain timeless, but Dominion is a movie that gives a tribute of sorts to what has transpired in the years that followed. Though I wouldn't call this movie awful, it gives off a feeble conclusion to the Jurassic World film trilogy.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">There was no chance this movie was going to be any good and it was not any good like predicted. I get it's about dinosaurs but how many times can the same people be cornered by a random dinosaur? And why do the dinosaurs only go for them? The dinosaurs have the characters dead to rights with their nose right against them but don't attack but then 5 seconds later the same dinosaur will bust through a window snapping at them.<br/><br/>These movies have gotten so stupid they forget the suspense that really made the first one so great. Now it's a dinosaur every 3 seconds snapping at them with another lucky escape time after time. Either let someone be killed for once or don't put them in that situation.<br/><br/>The original cast of Jurassic park do a great job with a lot of fan service call backs they do to the original like Ellie Sattler and her trademark stunner take off of her sunnies. Goldblum has a couple of great lines late that I enjoyed too.<br/><br/>It's such a bad movie and is so long and I will never watch this again. I hope this franchise can be put to bed now.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Conclusion the Jurassic series is no doubt the hardest to make: too many relationships to be completed, too many mysteries to be resolved, too many philosophies to be conveyed... After 3 decades and 6 movies, the riveting story between humans and dinosaurs ends in the not-so-exciting roar of the iconic tyrannosaurus rex - I'm naming her ""Roara"" by the way.<br/><br/>One big problem is the characters, who are just ""dead"". I feel no affection towards the old trio - Ellie's nonstop nosiness, Alan's love-driven motivation, and Gold... sorry, Ian's quirky humor, not a fan of any of those. In fact, their appearance serves only for the family reunion of the final act, a device that doesn't incite my nostalgia for the original Jurassic Park, but is quite awkward to watch. Owen and Claire continue their dalliance and misplaced sense of parenthood, which isn't explained anyhow. Maisie, good god girl, what exactly do you want? Her rebellious behavior got her abducted which she didn't even try to escape, and when she realized her true identity, instead of maturation, she ran away - where's the logistic? Lewis, who looks like Tim Cook and acts like a peanut-eating wealthy psychopath businessman, stomps around and slams his chair when provoked - why would such an emotionless villain suddenly have tantrum? Not to mention there're Ramsay and Kayla, who are purely tool characters without personal will. All of these figures play their part just according to the script, guiding the audience like a group of programmed NPCs.<br/><br/>However, I have to compliment the Second Act, which is surfeited with action scenes. Objectives are clear, stunts are breathtaking, creativity is shown. Environmental layouts are vast while meticulous, comprising exotic market, humid jungle, frozen lake, and lightless cave - all are fantastic stages for various creatures and actions. Most of the dinosaurs that the I envisioned participate - except for Blue and the mosasaurus - providing different levels of tension. Making the idiotic antagonist die to the dilophosauruses was a great allusion. I personally enjoyed the weaponization of the raptors, very inventive and definitely a human thing to do.<br/><br/>Let's talk about ideas as the film brings up three. One, purpose and potential of genetically replicated beings, in which Maisie realizes that she is allowed to be unique - an idea mentioned by countless books and movies, and is restated again. Also, the cloning technique further cures the swarm crisis, which leads us to the second idea: monopolization of food resources by putting dinosaur genomes in locusts. This one is not only unethical, illegal, but also stupid: there are so many ways in which dinosaurs could be used to make money, yet Biosyn chooses the most irrelevant and uncontrollable approach. Despite that, what nonsense script writer came up with the proposal that insects could be a great ""final boss"" for a dinosaur-themed movie? Jurassic World: Dominion of Bugs? Third, symbiosis of humans and dinosaurs, which is only brought up in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Ironically, the entire plot happens in a society where both organisms co-exist, and the world hasn't really changed anyway through the adventures that occurred. In short, this piece of work presents zero nutritious moral to reflect on.<br/><br/>Moreover, if we examine what the protagonists actually accomplished, it's not hard to tell that they are the destructive ones. Ellie and Alan transgresses company policies just for a conspiracy article, disturbing the harmony of mutant locusts which cause wildfire and mortalities. Owen and Kayla are warned not to land twice before crushing, damaging public infrastructures. Maisie recklessly releases a predatory animal, indirectly killing innocent office workers. Finally, the group shut down the premises' power without permission, and could be charged deliberate vandalism and murder of Lewis.<br/><br/>That's about it for the last Jurassic World: great actions sequences, but below standard everywhere else.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I feel this movie is the literaly the definition of expectations vs reality. When I heard this will be the last Jurassic Movie, I was kinda sad. After seeing it I really couldnt care less if this is the final movie. Its bad, and if you are not a die hard fan or a dino enthusiast, I don't recommend this movie. Also caracters are realy shalow and the final fight between rexy and giga was lame. It joust doesent have the magic of the other movies and Collin Trevaro ruined this movie with soo much potential. And repeating myself I would say that this franchise finaly died. Go watch Prehistoric Planet if you want something dino releated or if you wanna se a movie in a cinema go watch Top Gun or something else, not this excuse of a movie.<br/><br/>Also this movie when I wattched it it didn't feel like a Jurassic movie. I think that I would rather watch Morbious than this crap ever again. From me joust pure disapointment.<br/><br/>R. I. P. Jurassic Franchise, you made some of my favourite movies, but it is the time to go.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I bought this ticket coming off the high from Top Gun. Where they nailed nestslgia, Jurassic failed miserably. I'm ashamed I spent my money on it and I recommend you don't. And it was so freaking loud and unnecessarily violent. Bottom line is they knew they could make a good trailer and make all their money regardless of what the movie turned out to be. I'm almost without words. It was actually terrible. Might even be a 2. Trust everyone on here, don't see it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wasted 2.5 hrs. No story line. Forced characters. Doesn't make sense. Revisiting old scenes were awful. CGI is too game like. I remember watching the 1st Jurassic Park as a kid and thought the T. Rex was going to jump out of the screen. Overall one of the worse movie. Don't waste your time and money. It felt like a money grab by these movie makers exploiting a good classic movie. How much more can they milk this.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's a mess, story is scattered all over the place. Alan grand not even had any dialogues. The dinosaur experts constantly getting dinosaur names wrong , generic villain , generic plot , meaningless and pointless last dinosaur fight.<br/><br/>All the male characters are dump in the movie , chris Pratt's and Alan grant characters don't even have any dialogues. Chris Pratt's character a dinosaur expert gets a dinosaur name wrong and he gets corrected by strong female character , and multiple occasions he also get saved by this powerful female pilot character for no reason , Alan grant is silent in most of the scenes having no any dialogues. The overall message of toxic feminism and toxic equality runied this movie.<br/><br/>The character of female pilot is there for no reason, her motivation is not strong ,she had no reason, no story, she is just a strong female character who even knows more about dinosaurs than the male dinosaur experts. We can clearly see she is just there for representation, she is powerful than others, knows more than others about dinosaurs and just jammed up in the movie who got more dialogues than other main characters.<br/><br/>The villain is generic ,poorly written, his motivation is weak , he's just evil .<br/><br/>Don't even talk about dinosaurs, they are just hungry creatures, blue is barely in the movie, last T rex fight with was dump and pointless.<br/><br/>Over all this movie felt like watching a survival in dinosaur land video game , there is no any memorable scene or memorable dinosaur.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Incredible movie. It has emotion, nostalgia, humour, and is just a great film overall! The addition of a new cast of dinosaurs combined with a much different storyline keeps things fresh, but the inclusion of original cast members, throwback scenes, and nostalgic item inclusions gives that true Jurassic Park feeling.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It is a shame to see a franchise which has created something so great, go do this time and time again. My least favorite Jurassic World film by far. SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>The paleontology for one was just off, which I can live with being that JP never was supposed to be a paleo doc. The acting, especially in the first half was cringe worthy, definitely over acted. Can't blame the actors really cause we know most of them can act, therefore blame falls on the directing. Chris Pratt's character, Owen, was basically a side character, and BDH's character, Claire, was also reduced in significance and screen time to make room for the OG's. I wouldn't have a problem with this if it was not THEIR franchise. The original JP characters should have had a lesser role IMO. I hate to say it, but there were too many dinosaurs to put any significance on any particular one. The Giga was obviously supposed to be the main antagonist on the dino side, but the Giga had very little screen time and there was no build up to it. That being said, the final fight which was supposed to be epic, was lame as hell. I didn't care who won, even though we all knew the T-Rex would prevail. Also, the main plot was to kill the locust because they are killing crops which in turn would cause famine. Cool. How about all the dinosaurs that are out roaming around literally killing people directly. So they need to kill the locust but not the dinos which they could kill by doing the exact same thing? ""We have to learn to live with them"", lol ok.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honestly, this is the public opinion on these movies. They should have stopped at Jurassic park 1 and called it a day. Ruining its legacy with FIVE unwanted sequels is so sad to see. I used to love the original as a kid and watching it become a bland action movie is unbearable. The movie itself isn't offensive in any way, it's doing its job, pleasing 8 year olds with more dinosaur action. No characters except Jeff goldbloom's were exciting to watch and no story beats or plot lines were fun enough to get a single cheer or laugh out of me. Don't watch this movie and give them a reason to reboot it yet again.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I wanted to like this movie; I really did. But I could not. It is overlong, overstuffed with ridiculous plot lines that made watching it a chore. Of course, the whole concept of bringing dinosaurs back to life from the original onward is ridiculous, but ""Jurassic Park"" was so brilliantly executed and suspenseful that one could forget the implausibility of the whole thing. The series has gone downhill from then onward. And this movie represents the nadir of the series. Come on now, Chris Pratt is the dinosaur ""whisperer"" making promises to a raptor, please! And Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are brought back for no apparent reason other than nostalgia. Why are Laura Dern and Sam Neill invited to the villain's lair? Who knows? And why is Jeff Goldblum invited as well when all he is does in criticize the main villain's company? I found Campbell Scott's character reminiscent of an evil Tim Cook (not Steve Jobs as some have said). At least his performance was quietly creepy to me. The rest of the performances were passable at best - Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum appear to be embarrassed to be in the movie. The action scenes are poorly directed and not suspenseful. Therefore, I can only recommend the movie for Jurassic type completists like me - I just had to go even though I predicted it would be bad but hoped I was wrong. I was not. 5/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I love movies. I am dedicating my entire life to the wonderful craft of filmmaking that saved me from the darkness. Engrossing audiences in a compelling story with relatable characters and all the components that make up MOVIES.<br/><br/>This is not a movie.<br/><br/>This is a spectacle. A very bad, stupid spectacle. In recent years, I have come to realize that most big Hollywood movies are so hollow, generic and overall not compelling. I still have a mild amount of respect for the Marvel movies despite their flaws. They are most definitely not meant to be anything more than entertainment that appeals to the masses and families of the world but you can tell that they care about not being plain stupid and have that wonderful sense of fun.<br/><br/>This isn't. WAY TOO MUCH exposition, poorly executed ""action"" scenes, very stupid dialogue and it only relies on showing you scenes from the previous movies of the franchise (even JP3, believe it or not). I wouldn't even recommend this movie to general families, they'll probably be bored and leave the theater frustrated.<br/><br/>Please do not support this. You deserve better entertainment that will respect your intelligence. You deserve better.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nice to see Sam Neill. Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum reprise there roles from Jurassic Park (1993), feeling that the chemistry is still there. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are good reprising there roles also. And the effects with dinosaurs are perfectly well done. And one character who didn't serve much of a purpose in Fallen Kingdom, serves a bigger purpose here.<br/><br/>My only complaint here is the main bad guy, never for a once comes across to fearful, I only wish he was better written. But chase scenes are well shot. So please let it end here.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow. Great adventure. Much better than the last, Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. I have been great fan of Jurassic films. You can't the original. That's the best film by far out of all Jurassic films. I did enjoy Jurassic Park III for the Spinosaurus and did like Jurassic World 2015 too. The latest film isn't pathbreaking, because after three Jurassic films, it could never be path breaking but the plot is much better than the lame last film which was the worst in the series. Return of Dr. Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm is great, what else you can ask for.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Truly if you take away the visuals and some old references to previous Jurassic Parks this movie truly has no real plot or direction<br/><br/>The legacy characters are doing their own sub plot while the modern characters are having their own plot both of which are incredibly bland and doesn't hold any weight<br/><br/>By the end their paths cross and that's it, really nothing happens or anything dramatic it was just stale and painful to watch.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was amazing. On the genetic aspect the movie might be thin but on the ecological aspect this movie hits hard. The way it depicts the beauty of evolution and the importance of coexistence is incredible. Coexistence is something humanity needs to do with the rest of the planet to achieve balance and prevent all the world threatening problems. I know that there are a lot of negative reviews about this movie but what I am saying is this movie conveys a really tough message. It is a true science fiction film not like the superhero movies which are made just for entertainment. It not just a movie it's an emotion.</div>

Weapons are guided by lasers. Story and acting were pretty dull. They have too much characters to focus on. Location keeps changing constantly. Their was no focus besides the dinosaurs, locust, and a few characters that you liked.<br/><br/>Nothing changed between dinosaurs and humans. Avoid this movie.

<div class=""text show-more__control"">They should have known better, the script has so many plot holes that I lost the count at half the movie. Acting is poor, directing is poor, CGI is poor, puppetry is surprisingly poor, and the soundtrack is also poor. The sound mix and maybe the cinematography are the only things that maybe are worth it. First, they spit you every dinosaur you could imagine, only to forget about the dinosaur in the following take. Second, even while you already know it is a meaningless plot, you won't find continuity in it, third, the acting is so bad and fake that this movie could actually be entertaining as a comedy maybe? Fourth: The movie is so cheesy and boring that even from the beginning you lose empathy even with the dinosaurs themselves. Fifth: the dinosaurs have great textures but they lack physics which makes the first movie more believable than this one. Summary: Total mess, waste of money and time.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Lets face it, it could be better. Not the best Jurassic movie, but yet I liked it. I'm a big fan of Jurassic park and I was really happy when they announced the Jurassic world. My childhood came to life.<br/><br/>For this movie, I knew it wasn't going to surprise me, but I wanted the end, I wanted to say goodbye to my beloved dinos. And even it wasn't the best, I was pretty satisfied. I think we got a lot of closures. Maisie's origin, much more dinos than ever, old actors back together and their own ""moment"" :D and I was really glad for Henry, he always wanted to do something incredible and most of time it didn't work, but this time he gets his redemption. Overall it's not the best but it did make my heart flutter one last time. Still loves the franchise and I hope for those who loved the original trilogy will find the same satisfactory like I did...<br/><br/>Life always finds a way.... this time we were given coexisting world, when dinos live with us. I don't know about you guys but I was more than okay with the ending like this. :)</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was hyped for this movie because of the return of the original cast, I thought they couldn't do this wrong, the original cast and actors were rich and really well written.<br/><br/>Well, I don't know if it's just nostalgia speaking, but I think Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ian Malcolm delivered they role pretty well. Just like in the first movie, acting was on point, and I even felt a bit of Alan Grant from JP1 feelings, which made me very happy since he is my favourite character of the franchise. Also I felt like they did gave them enough screen time, and that made me really happy as well, seeing a 74 year old Sam Neill being able to deliver such good acting and performance is always delightful to me.<br/><br/>However the movie lacks story. Unfortunately they gave a major role to the Maisie Lockwood and forgot about the real thing that made the movies so good, dinosaurs being a constant threat. They even tried to make some shots where dinosaurs were scary and also felt really dangerous, but it wasn't the main focus since those locust thing took over the plot.<br/><br/>I don't even want to brag too much about the forced women ""empowerment"" being present on the movie because I don't want the movie to be ruined by political agenda. So I'll just say that, basically, you can notice that sometimes women are pushed too far into the role of ""empowered"" and it feels really off. As sometimes it feels like women are the only ones who come up with good ideas or that are really in condition to help and save men. JP1 had some lines and things that were empowering for women, and that was really fine, because it wasn't forced upon viewers and women weren't super badass not needed to be the only ones to solve problems.<br/><br/>So Dodgson is the main villain, if they tried to connect him with the JP1 Dodgson, they failed miserably. Or at least it should've been clearer the link between the two (father and son perhaps?) and even seeing the barber canister that Nedry dropped on Dilophosaurus paddock on JP1 (which we assumed was lost under the mud from that rainy day), wasn't enough to make up for it.<br/><br/>I guess you can say this movie have a good idea of reuniting the original cast, but it doesn't live up to the expectations of the JP1 and Lex and Tim should've made at least one small appearance in the movie since they are now bigger and are a part of the world since their grandpa died.<br/><br/>Speaking of John Hammond, it looks like Lockwood became the main name on dinosaurs genetics, since movie tried some sort of retcon that the ""original"" Charlotte was already in Jurassic Park at that time first movie happened, but that doesn't make any sense and doesn't add up to the plot or the movie.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">This latest Jurassic installment doesn't bring much did the table that we haven't already seen before. While it was nice seeing the original characters reunite, the film lacked any sort of charisma compared to the previous films. Not even O'Neill, Dern or Goldblum could elevate the material. Lastly, the dinosaur ""battles"" felt pedantic and uninspired. Overall, no great Spielbergian ""Whoa!"" moments. 6/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">7/10 - maybe I'm just a sucker for a legacy cast return a la Scream and Spider-Man: No Way Home, but if you can get past the rambling and frankly unnecessary first hour, some bad acting from the majority of the cast (Dern, Wise, Athie, and Howard are the major exceptions), and some not good and maybe even bad cinematography, you will find a lot to enjoy in this sixth installment and end of a Jurassic era even with its flaws.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Okay, i'm not really a fan of Jurassic Series, (Especially after JW Fallen Kingdom) but this is so much worse. I came to the theatre with low expectation (since the review are not really good) so i thought i could enjoy some dinosaur fight. Well, guess what? Nothing happen. The story was dull, even the conversation between characters feels corny. Bad acting (especially the one who play as maisie). And the funny thing is, everytime one of the character do something, they just start hugging and high five. The villain have no motivation and emotionless. There's two action scene that i thought it was decent, but it just hold for 8 minutes. So you guys must see the another 139 minutes pointless story to get there, plus unfunny moment everywhere with bad scoring.<br/><br/>Epic conclusion of Jurassic era? I don't think so, even after the credit start rolling, the audience cant get the conclusion of what ever happened in the movie. But actually the movie could work if they have better story, like how humans and dinosaur live together and they can make the movie two parts, rather than execute this stupid story of how another bad company try to rule the world (again) and forced everything to collide because every character try to finished their own task just to meet at the end to say Hi. But hey, this is just my opinion, you can agree or disagree but this just felt really wrong. But this is the worst movie i've ever seen.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie, well of course the animation, and Jeff Goldblum as Jeff Goldblum (Chris Pratt acting was decent but he seems doesn't want to be in the movie).<br/><br/>Goofy Ah Movie. And just like another franchise, the studio will start a spin off or maybe do another useless reboot.<br/><br/>Personal Rating: 1/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Utterly disappointing end to the saga. The dinosaurs are a sideline for the stupidly dumb prehistoric genetically modded locust plot which is the obsessive fixation of this films story. Those giving it 10/10 you must be trolls or bots.<br/><br/>Gave it a 5 because of the childhood nostalgia and the original cast. Least Dr Grant and Dr Ellie finally get together.<br/><br/>CGI is terrible. It's aged badly already.<br/><br/>Camera judder throughout.<br/><br/>The bad guy... let's not mention him or where the director and producer found him.<br/><br/>Went to see it hoping it would be a great last hurrah to a series I love and for it do the original proud.

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I saw this with my nephew yesterday. The CGI, sound design, and camera were all topnotch as you would expect from a Jurassic Park film. Even the few shots of practical effects were quality. This was very expensive to make for sure.<br/><br/>But everything else was flat and mindlessly, needlessly complicated. The first big problem I had with it was that it's WAY too long by at least an hour. The runtime became almost torture. It's like they kept inventing problems for the characters to solve for the sake of a longer duration.<br/><br/>The next thing was that there was too much going on. There were multiple plots within the plot so it felt disjointed. And some of them were pointless. You've got a human clone with a story about her mother and the clone's search for her identity, a locust plague, a conspiracy, some more stuff, and then the dinosaurs. It was cluttered.<br/><br/>With any Jurassic Park movie, I think less is more. The original adaptation did it best and I don't believe its magic will ever be recreated: A mysterious park with cloned dinosaurs who escape. The characters then try to survive the chaos. Throw in unbelievable filmmaking craftsmanship with lovable characters and we had a winner. That's it. That's all we needed.<br/><br/>I will say that it was better than Fallen Kingdom. I can't declare that I outright hated Dominion but I wouldn't bother with it again and found it forgettable. Having the original cast back was nice to see but it didn't do anything to help beyond the warm nostalgic factor.<br/><br/>This certainly wasn't a fitting end to the franchise.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">That is a bold statement, but it's honestly how I feel after watching Dominion. The plot is horrible, the sub plots you simply don't care about, the script is awful, The three legacy actors show hardly any emotion towards anything... I love Sam Neill as much as the next person but he is extremely flat and one dimensional in this as is Laura Dern and Geoff Goldblum. The three original characters and the new characters were always going to cross paths in this movie, we all knew it was coming. But problem is, it was so poorly executed. The old characters and new characters just barely connect with each other apart from escaping dinosaur chases together...<br/><br/>Dominion is just full of overused movie clichés, It's like it can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be... ANOTHER T-rex fight with a dinosaur that's bigger and more scary looking than it is... a James Bond style bike chase where Owen is being chased by Raptors through a city, a pointless gun fight that does nothing but soak up a few minutes of movie time. Not to mention the locust subplot that's just awfully implemented into this film. Like that's the main issue that humans are faced with now? Dinosaurs are just a normal part of modern life on Earth now but locusts are now the main problem everyone's worried about? Right, whatever!<br/><br/>The Allosaurus stalking the entire character cast around the jeep and making no attempt to attack anyone until the plot decides its convenient. A Pteradactyl that can rip apart a plane like it's a feather pillow, stick its beak straight into one of the jet engines and sustain no injury whatsoever, Owen Grady and a couple others chasing Parasaurs on horseback and trying to lasso one of them like it's some country western... These are just some of the cheesy, overblown and poorly written aspects of Dominion... They attempted to give some development to the character of Lewis Dodgson and to show what Biosyn (InGen's competition), has been up to since the old days but it's far too little, far too late... by this point in time, none of us even remotely care.<br/><br/>People say JP3 is the worst of the franchise but I disagree... at least JP3 has that intense survival element to it and being stuck on an island gives it that sense of isolation. With dominion, you just don't care about anyone because you can tell that no one is going to die except for the bad guys. It's so predictable, In fact, you just find yourself not even caring about what happens because the plot isn't worth caring about... If anything, all you will be caring about is checking your watch or your phone to see how much longer you have to suffer through this mess of a film.<br/><br/>I just hope now they can leave the franchise alone once and for all and that Colin Trevorrow can be assigned to direct something half decent in the future.<br/><br/>The people rating this movie 10/10 give me a break.... You all need a god damn reality check!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">A lot of random scenes of characters being in peril by dinosaurs, one scene after another, and it got tiring very quickly. Storyline could've been better, it was just a rescue mission, and that's it, no other depths or levels, but the girl has one emotion that got annoying, wide eyed and surprised. The movie went way too long, could've been wrapped up in 90 minutes, I got bored.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Where do I start? This will contain spoilers so beware.<br/><br/>Firstly, let's get one think clear. It's Jurassic World, it's about dinosaurs so you have to be open to just switching your brain off and enjoying the fantasy of the movies for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Is it entertaining? Yeah. From the opening news footage it pretty much stays at full throttle save a couple of slow scenes early on. They've definitely recycled a few scenes from the past Jurassic movies. Is that lazy or a cheeky nod to the past knowing fans will love it?<br/><br/>The bringing the old characters back is a nostalgia trip that would be wasted on younger audiences but it was fun to kind of bring things full circle. They've all aged incredibly well too.<br/><br/>The scenes in Malta, pretty much one 15 minute action scene seems to fancy itself as a bit of a Bond rip off, maybe it just looks similar and there's a motorbike chase.<br/><br/>There is no real story as such, something about genetic huge insects wiping out all the crops putting the future of mankind at risk - writing that out it makes me realise they were wise to make it a paper thin storyline.<br/><br/>Let's be honest, you know what you're going to get going into the theatre. You either like this type of thing or you don't. It's CGI monsters lots of running around and slight jump scares. It's been done better but it's been done a lot worse.<br/><br/>Doesn't set itself up for another adventure so could well be the end of the franchise, but 6 films is probably enough.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Not scary, not even thrilling. There were kids in the theater and even they were bored.<br/><br/>The whole point of Jurassic Park is the fear that the ancient predators are SUPPOSED to invoke. The terror from the original for me came when chars did everything logical and still got eaten. In this, you can out run raptors on foot, hide barely a inch underwater, slowly walk away from a dino as long as there's a car between you, and if you do get cornered without a weapon... just hold out your hand. WTF?! The writers have been watching too much How to Train Your Dragon. Why was the whole movie about locusts and not the dinosaurs?! They could've at least made them carnivorous locusts and had a scene where they stripped a bronto to bones in minutes. At least there's be some real threat in this pointless movie. I'm joking but it might've been a better movie if they took half the human leads out and had Blue the raptor fight her way through all the new species herself.<br/><br/>Save your money. Gas, food, and tickets are too expensive now to be wasted on this movie.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Twenty-nine years ago, when ""Jurassic Park"" was released, computer-generated and digitally composited effects were still relatively new, but director Steven Spielberg's team raised them to a new level of credibility by deploying them sparingly, often in nighttime and rainy scenes, and mixing them with old-fashioned practical FX work (mainly puppets and large-scale models). The result conjured primal wonder and terror in the minds of viewers. The T-Rex attack in particular was so brilliantly constructed and unrelentingly frightening that it put this writer sideways in his seat, one arm raised in front of his face as if to defend against a dinosaur attack. When there was a break in the mayhem, Spielberg cut to a very quiet scene, letting everyone hear how many people in the audience had been screaming in fright, which of course led to raucous laughter and a release of tension (a foolproof showman's trick). A small girl sitting near this writer regarded his still-terror-contorted body and asked, ""Mister, are you all right?""There's nothing in ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" that comes close to that first ""Jurassic Park"" T-Rex attack, or any other scene in it. Or for that matter, any of the scenes in the Spielberg-directed sequel ""The Lost World,"" which made the best of an inevitable cash-grab scenario by treating the film as an excuse to stage a series of dazzling large-scale action sequences, and giving Jeff Goldblum's chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm the action hero job. Goldblum, who reprises his role in ""Dominion"" alongside fellow original cast members Sam Neill and Laura Dern, turned his ""Lost World"" performance into a wry-yet-cranky meta-commentary on corporate capitalism. For that matter, there's nothing in this new film as good as the best parts of ""Jurassic Park III,"" ""Jurassic World,"" and ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"" the latter which suffered from diminishing-returns syndrome, yet still managed to stage a crackerjack action scene or dino attack here and there. J. A. Bayona's mixed-bag ""Fallen Kingdom,"" which provides literal as well as figurative DNA to the plot of ""Dominion,"" had the most surprising pivots since the original, conjuring Spielbergian images of wonder (think of that mournful shot of the brachiosaur left behind on the dock) and mixing gothic horror and haunted house-movie elements into its second half. ""Jurassic Park"" creator Michael Crichton's original inspiration, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, was referenced through the character of Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), a clone created by John Hammond's business partner to replace the daughter that he lost.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""We're racing toward the extinction of our species. We not only lack dominion over nature, we're subordinate to it."" Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum)<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion may arguably be almost as good as the original. Anyway, it's quite entertaining summer adventure fare with the CGI dinosaurs more realistic than ever, including the biggest carnivore in the world, yes more fearsome than T Rex. The real dinosaurs are the returning veterans Laura Dern, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Neill, and the inimitable Jeff Goldblum. You just can't put them down even with the failure of at least two other theme parks.<br/><br/>In order to fulfill the rigid requirements of the adventure genre, there must be a serious bad guy, and this Jurassic has Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott). He runs a sanctuary lab that houses homeless dinos but really serves as a platform for world dominion.<br/><br/>You got it-the four heroes go through innumerable dino encounters to stop the maniac genius. But enough plot, of which there is nary a nuance, because the relationships of good people throughout are pleasantly emphasized so that we care about each one.<br/><br/>We saw this Jurassic in a Phoenix Theater's Dolby Atmos, a splendid screening venue that titillates with sound moving your seat ever so slightly. When the dino stomps, our seats respond with a tingle. So, our Jurassic joy is watching and feeling the best motion pictures have to offer. Together with the most comfortable seats in town, it's a pleasant safari with monstrous animals, some over 60 million years old.<br/><br/>The larger point writer/director Colin Trevorrow and writer Emily Carmichael make is about cooperation-be it among family and co-workers or dinos and humans, we have no choice but to work in harmony. Or otherwise, damnation it is or total annihilation. Having lived in the last three years with a microscopic monster, it's nice to see ones big as buildings with the hope that we will survive together, if only in the salutary world of Hollywood dreams.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion is a most pleasant way to enjoy a summer night out, even when it hints of extinction:<br/><br/>""The doomsday clock might be out of time."" Ian Malcolm.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Sadly this is probably the best of the latest three Jurassic movies, which is not saying much. This movie take great use of Narration and dragged out explanation so at times I think the entire movie is narrated like a documentary. We also get the usual environment propaganda how we should live in peace and harmony with nature - and this narration is told while Chris Pratt releases a deadly predator into the wild where it can murder more humans... yea, that happen...<br/><br/>And perhaps that is the least believable with these movies. We all know the military would have killed everything, even nuked that island if need be. But they don't because the plot need to happen.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is okayish. The CGi is pretty great, the acting great, music and sets great. The problem with this is that we have seen it all before. This movie is basically a copy paste of all previous movies, sprinkled with some narration. The writing, and dialogue is horrible and often cringe. The storytelling is just a convoluted mess.<br/><br/>I assume if you liked the previous ones you might like this too, it is perhaps even better than the last one just more boring since we seen it all already.<br/><br/>I give this a very generous 4/10. The reason for that high score is that everything cinematography and the acting is at the very top. But don't kid yourself, this is a really bad movie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm a huge fan of the original Jurassic Park series, so I was completely stoked when I heard that the original cast would be in this movie. But wow! This movie was clearly made for a quick money grab. Has no respect for the fans of the series as it brings back the original cast in such an uninspiring way with such a stupid plot. Locusts??? C' mon Hollywood is this the best you can come up with for a dinosaur movie? Lacks any sort of creativity and the dinosaur scenes didn't bring any excitement like the original ones. They could have went in so many directions but opted to take the shortest way to revenue. I was so bored throughout the movie and couldn't believe this garbage was made. Honestly, it's the worst Jurassic movie ever made. Save your money and rewatch the old ones.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Watched JWD last night and I did not enjoy it. The dinosaurs are so humanized it does not seem real. If I wanted to watch a movie about a girl being kidnapped I would have watched Taken or something similar. Too many main characters in this movie and it is all about them and a bunch of bugs...the dinosaurs just happen to be there. Bring back the animatronics and bring back the fear. The scenes in the original and 2nd movie gave you chills and had you on the edge of your seat. Very very disappointed in the last 3 movies.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I don't know what happened to Colin Trevorrow or if he got drunk while directing this movie, but it's pretty bad. So bad that 1 hour into it I was ready to walk out of the theatre and go home. The plot or plots of the movie are unbelievable and unrealistic, so much so that it takes you out of the immersion you're supposed to feel during a Jurassic Park movie. That's what made the originals so great, is that you could put yourself in their shoes and feel what they were feeling and there were real life/death moments! This movie you don't get that feeling. All the characters are protected with plot armor and survive every 100 Dino attacks. The main focus of this movie was to stop prehistoric locusts from destroying the worlds food supply. The movie should've been called LOCUSTS. The dinosaurs play a side character to this terrible plot.<br/><br/>Whereas this movie would've been so much better if it were grounded in realism and real stakes were put on hand. I don't care if Ian Malcom or Dr. Grant has to die, make us feel the horror of a giant carnivore coming after them! You would also assume that after the 2nd movie, the government would've done everything in their power to exterminate these dinosaurs rather than accept them as part of the ecosystem. Why not make that the plot? Make the government the villain and have the main cast come together to save blue from death while every other dinosaur is being wiped out. But like I said, another missed opportunity!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Jurassic World series is just another example how cheap/lazy Hollywood is becoming. This last sequel felt very unimaginative when it comes to storyline &amp; plot. At least a few moments of just bad writing and unrealistic situations/outcomes (if it were real). Few things that bugged me to list: the beginning involving the illegal dinosaur sanctuary that the 3 characters from the last film break into and their getaway van... they escape by breaking down an entrance gate yet how did they get the van inside to begin with?! The airplane scene involving the aerodactyl with the owen characer saying ""is that another plane"" (was in a trailer).. what aircraft in the world makes a sound similar to a bird squawking?! The African-American pilot with Owen being chased by the raptor like bird that can also swim; near the end of that scene the lady starts screaming while their running to the gate door which was an obvious throwback to Jurassic Park 1 and the kitchen scene involving the girl... but it ruins the contuinity of the character since throughout the rest of the film she is level-headed/fearless and doesn't panic once (scene with her plane being ripped apart, the flying on fire locusts, being chased by the more deadly version of the T-Rex &amp; etc)... yet she screams over something lesser?! They obviously relied on the 3 original cast members of Jurassic Park to help sell even though I did enjoy the banter between Malcom &amp; Grant. On top of the nostalgia from Jurassic Park which is where the lack of creativity comes in. Even things that don't make any logical sense such as a promise to a Raptor... its a predatory animal?!?! Locusts on fire yet flying around?! The final battle is just a copy-cat of Jurassic World 1 that is completely unrealistic... 3 predators.. it would be a 3-way fight, not some sort of ""tag team"" battle of 2vs1.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I hadn't enjoyed such a good JURASSIC movie in a long time. Screen time is given to both new and old characters. It was a great decision to bring the original cast. 2 and a half hours that pass in the blink of an eye, enjoyable from start to end. It is an excellent closure coming from previous installments that were not very good (although if they want they can exploit the saga more).</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie looked great. It was promising when it started and had an exciting start. But the plot was very implausible. Knowing it is a dinosaur movie, I don't expect all of it to be realistic. However, the time line and plausibility of the events of characters left me disappointed with a lot of the avenues they decided to take. It was all a little too convenient. From bouncing around the world in a day to a pilot they never met giving her only parachute to a complete stranger, surviving a crash landing of a plane without a scratch on the passengers, it was too much. The animation was amazing, but it's unfortunate they can't do both these days.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Firstly, There was some absolutely Great Dinosaur Action on screen. That scene with Bryce underwater was such a Beautiful Shot.<br/><br/>But..........<br/><br/>It's a Ok 7 out of 10 Movie. Unfortunately that's not good enough for a Major Summer Blockbuster.<br/><br/>Lower Tier Movies have a Baseline of 5, 6 and 7 out of 10. Not Blockbusters Which have the Capacity for a 9 and 10 out of 10 Cinematic Experience.<br/><br/>Here's the Gripes -<br/><br/>1. There is a lot going on in this movie but that isn't really the problem.<br/><br/>2. The problem is the Writing and the lack of tieing things together properly and the performances from the Villain and of some of the other characters. They don't sell it well enough.<br/><br/>3. The Villains performance was Terrible. When you have a bad villain, your movie is in trouble.<br/><br/>That Being Said, I actually enjoyed it for what it was.<br/><br/>Good Parts -<br/><br/>1. The Malta Section of the Movie was Really Good.<br/><br/>2. The Thin Ice Scene was Good.<br/><br/>3. The Scene With Bryce holding her breath underwater to escape was Absolutely Excellent. What A Cinematic Shot That Was.<br/><br/>4. The scene when the huge Dinosaur wraps his Jaw around the ladder when the little girl is climbing was a Great Visual Scene.<br/><br/>5. The Locations were Beautiful to see on Screen.<br/><br/>6. There were multiple different shots and scenes with such good Dinosaur Action.<br/><br/>Overall, A one time Watch.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am appalled at my decision to spend my hard earned cash and see this at the cinema. I am thoroughly surprised at the legacy character actors decision to take on this movie. They would have balked at the ridiculousness and blandness of the script, yet the money clearly swayed their decision to take it on. I swear, watching Chris Pratt try to tame the dinosaurs with his repetitive'talk to the hand' motion, I felt like I was going to vomit. Please avoid this like the plague. The studios don't deserve to make money off us with this one. PS- I absolutely couldn't stand the young girl: the character and her ridiculous plot line, and the two dimensional actor.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World Dominion is a good with a quite a problematic final chapter to a second trilogy of Jurassic World/Park franchise with an obvious helps from the three original cast though they not did used them perfectly but it's not horribly either, an unconvincing early topic and performance from new and main characters but as the time goes it works just fine, a great and satisfying enough CGI action especially the final battle, it is very nice to see Alan, Ellie, and Malcolm back on it again and it will be pretty much make the fans happy enough like me, as of Owen and Claire they did just as fine as the previous one (not a big fan of them in the first Jurassic World), so overall Jurassic World Dominion is quite a nice theater experience, it's the longest in the franchise and enjoy it thoroughly, and as the movie itself, it's good.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World: Dominion feels like the most expensive fan-made film ever put to cinema. There's an overdose of nostalgia and good visuals to be had and many fun nods to to the original. Sam Neill and Laura Dern also make their long awaited (and welcome) return to the franchise and the chemistry they share is nice, it's as if no time has passed at all since Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>However, their return serves only to remind us why this sixth instalment has absolutely nothing on the original Spielberg classic. Simply put, the chemistry shared between Neill, Dern and Jeff Goldblum is not nearly enough to distract from Dominion's awfully dumb story, truly naff dialogue (""I promise I'm gonna get her back!"") and the noticeably bored performances of Pratt and Dallas Howard.<br/><br/>In fact, unlike the original Jurassic Park, this is a lot more bore than awe. The action totally jumps the raptor, too, with the lowest stakes possible. You just know Owen Toretto and the gang are going to survive each and every dinosaur encounter which totally devours any tension. There's no horror, barely any excitement of any kind.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this but as a legacy sequel, Top Gun: Maverick this is not. Couple all of the above with a runtime as long as the Cretaceous period itself and you get a rather disappointing end to the World trilogy and the Jurassic franchise as a whole.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'll be honest here, I went into this movie with low expectations, this is because I read some of the reviews about how rubbish it is and how it's just a cash grab. But now that I have seen it I can proudly say it was a good movie and ending to a franchise.<br/><br/>But I will say this there is so much plot holes in this film so if your going to see it just for the plot you will come out really disappointed. It's a leave your brain at the door film. Just enjoy it for what it is.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I personally enjoyed ""Jurassic World"" as well as ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"", therefore I had rather high hopes for the last film of the trilogy. I walked in with an open mind and was thoroughly disappointed by each and every scene. Everything fell short of a good film, the acting, the CGI, even the the story itself felt like a mash between three or four plots. To try and point out every mistake this film made would be impossible, seeing that every scene had something wrong with it. A very predictable film, which lead to very predictable outcomes; certainly one of the weaker installments in the franchise.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I consider myself a very big Jurassic Park fan, but I'm also a very critical one. I love the original movie for its atmosphere, the fascinating dinosaurs, the scary scenes and the immersive story. After a few so-so sequels, Jurassic World did a great job of capturing what made JP so wonderful for me.<br/><br/>I guess I'm liking the wrong things about the Jurassic franchise, because the newer movies focus on totally different things. Compared to JP and JW, Jurassic World Dominion feels more like an action movie that happens to have dinosaurs and recurring characters in it.<br/><br/>It goes from dino attack to dino chase, to dino battle, to dino attack, etc. Hardly ever does the movie build up tension, let the characters grow friendships, or take the time to tell a nice story.<br/><br/>If you like seeing lots of different dinosaurs in different action scenes, you'll probably love this movie. If you were hoping for something with that Jurassic Park vibe, this might not be it. And no, not even the original cast and some Easter eggs can do the trick.</div>

The trailers led you to believe that you would be watching a narrative about man surviving amongst a Jurassic takeover. The film was filled with heavy, unnecessary dialogue with a story plot so slow and mind numbing, it's beyond me how anyone thought this would be a fitting conclusion to the series. So very, very disappointed and upset that this is how a childhood franchise has made itself extinct. It hurts so much that this is the ending we got.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let me start off with the positives by saying that it was great to see the Jurassic Park OGs back in the film. Them, combined with Bryce and Chris, it was a good combo of actors. And the CGI was spot on, so the dinosaurs looked incredible. But that's where all the positives stop.<br/><br/>The plot and storylines were very poor. And quite a few of the scenes in the film were so stupid, you'd be forgiven for thinking you was watching a comical version of any famous action film. I mean one scene involved Owen in Paris, he was inside this illegal dinosaur establishment, a big dinosaur munches up one of the bad guys and he is casually on the phone talking next to the dinosaur. That was ridiculous. Him on the motorbike escaping two chasing raptors was like watching John Wick high on ecstasy on 3x camera speed. Or when he jumps inside an icy pond and comes out like he's been for a dip in the Mediterranean Sea. A real person would be freezing with hypothermia!<br/><br/>The dinosaurs were used poorly throughout in most scenes. We rarely so dinosaurs attacking humans properly, just the occasional scene. I can only assume the ending fight scene, where the T-Rex teams up with a bird like dinosaur against a Gigantasaurus, was a desperate attempt by the production team to salvage what they probably realised was a poor film. I mean that was a totally unnecessary scene and replicating something we've already seen.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the ""bad guy"" of the film. He reminded me of Tim Cook from Apple, he was about as villian as Santa Claus not delivering a parcel to someone.<br/><br/>If I were you, save your money and watch this film when it comes out on TV for free.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie was great, fantastic way to introduce young people to the legacy characters, the movie, while long, was incredibly interesting the whole way through.<br/><br/>I can see some reviews citing the length as boring or the plot as bad, but I'd hasten to say a lot of them missed the point of what was happening.<br/><br/>The action scenes with dinosaurs were, as always, a favourite. A lot of the longer scenes do a fantastic job building up the plot and delving into the lore of the franchise, the two new heroes introduced in this movie were great, Chris Pratt was superb and all the legacy characters were so much fun.<br/><br/>Don't be wavered by any negative reviews you see, go and watch the film for yourself, I highly, highly, recommend it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Greetings again from the darkness. It's been almost 30 years since Steve Spielberg captivated us, and John Hammond (the late Sir Richard Attenborough) ""spared no expense"" in stunning Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) with our first look at dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK (1993). Best-selling author Michael Crichton's original characters and ideas have since spun off into THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (1997), JURASSIC PARK III (2001), JURASSIC WORLD (2015), and JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM (2018). We now have this latest franchise entry to cap off the second dinosaur trilogy, and it finds director Colin Trevorrow back at the helm. He also wrote the story and screenplay with Derek Connolly and Emily Carmichael.<br/><br/>The big news here (other than the dinosaurs) is the 4-doctor reunion of Dr. Alan Grant (Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), and Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong). It's the first time all of these characters have reunited since the original, and those of us who hold a special place in our movie heart for the transformative 1993 film, are most appreciative of the nostalgic touch. However, the hopes for a magical finale to conclude the franchise are dashed in the film's opening segment ... a cringe-worthy ""news"" report designed to catch us up four years after the destruction of Isla Numbar, and set the stage for what's to come.<br/><br/>You might assume that dinosaurs roaming our planet would be the headliner, but somehow locusts get the nod. Well, they are genetically modified locusts threatening the world's non-Biosyn food supply. See, Biosyn is the evil corporation run by twitchy CEO Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) that is attempting to control dinosaurs, the food supply, and even human cloning via DNA manipulation. It's that last part that brings Maisie Lockwood (an excellent Isabella Sermon) into the fold, and the DNA-mix also provides an easy punchline to Trevorrow's approach to this final film (blending DNA from the two trilogies). Maisie has been living deep in the Sierra Nevada forest with Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). When poachers nab both the offspring of Owen's favorite raptor and his quasi-offspring Maisie, the hunt is on. The only question remaining is how are they going to finesse this so that the old crew (Grant and Ellie) collides with the new crew (Owen and Claire)?<br/><br/>A stop in Malta to confront smuggler Santos (an impeccably dressed Dichen Lachman) results in the film's most frenetic action sequence. As Owen eludes trained killer-raptors while zipping his motorcycle across streets, alleys, and stairwells, Claire is sprinting (not in high heels) across rooftops like she's Jason Bourne or James Bond. While Owen and Claire deliver the heart-pounding action, Ellie has tracked down Grant on a dig in New Mexico, where he's ""educating"" a group of teenagers who remain glued to their mobile devices. Ellie convinces Grant to help in her mission to expose Biosyn, but we get the feeling he's making the trip for her, not to save humanity. With an assist from ice-cold pilot-for-hire Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise), everyone ends in Italy's Dolomite Mountains at Biosyn's stunning headquarters. Slowly the connections become apparent, as it's Malcolm (Goldblum) who is the resident philosopher (all evil corps need one), and the one who has been feeding intel to Ellie.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie exists so that all of these characters, along with Biosyn whistleblower Ramsay (Mamoudou Athie) can get in and out of trouble and dodge various stages of peril. The callbacks and nods to previous 'Jurassic' films are numerous. Some work and some don't. Malcolm's sardonic quips are mostly in tune, Grant's grumping and knowledge are spot on, and Ellie has remarkably little to do for someone who is responsible for one of the two main plot lines. Owen and Claire spend the bulk of their non-Malta time consistently recreating the facial expressions that have become all too familiar, though of course, Owen does get to hold out his palm in an attempt at controlling dinosaurs. There is a well-timed small dose of John Williams' iconic score from 1993, but it's the musical work of composer Michael Giacchino who mostly guides us along the way.<br/><br/>Credit goes to director Trevorrow for the multiple location shoots around the globe, which helps minimize the set pieces ... most of which disappoint. Especially surprising was the weak CGI effort in the mines as some of the characters end up where they shouldn't be. DNA manipulation run amok is perhaps the underlying theme, but we have to ask why this is ... all we really desire are cool dinosaurs and a story that makes sense. Despite the film's best shot coming at the end - a Mosasaurus underwater - we do hope that, in regards to continuing the franchise, Hollywood doesn't find a way.<br/><br/>Opens in theaters on June 10, 2022.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World Dominion is the last movie of the franchise that felt more like a reunion between the first trilogy and the second. The storyline was predictable and quick with a messy script that was all over the place. This last one takes place four years after the original island is lost to a volcanic eruptions and most of the dinosaurs that perished from the lava. The protagonist ended up being Campbell Scott who runs a pharmaceutical company to control the world's food supply by man made locusts. The original cast consisting of Laura Dern and Sam Neil are brought together for one last adventure. The acting was subpar, but the editing was superb especially with the special effects of the dinosaurs. The movie was a hit and miss, I neither loved it or hated it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw Jurassic World Dominion, starring Chris Pratt-the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, The Magnificent Seven_2016; Bryce Dallas Howard-Rocketman, Spider_Man 3; Campbell Scott-House of Cards_tv, the Amazing Spider_Man movies and DeWanda Wise-The Harder They Fall, She's Gotta Have It_tv.<br/><br/>This is the 6th in the series-the first one was in 1993-and this is the 3rd with the newer cast members. There are 4 cast members from the 1993 original that are woven into the plot line and get to work alongside the newer cast members; Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and B D Wong. This movie takes place about 4 years after the last one-2018s' Fallen Kingdom-where Chris and Bryce are now living in the woods away from everyone with their science created adopted daughter. She was created using DNA by her mother/scientist, with no father involved, to eradicate any diseases or defects of which the mother died of. Dinosaurs are now living among us, living and hunting alongside the public with most cohabiting reasonably well-I did say most. The more dangerous ones are secluded in facilities that are meant to control them. Campbell plays a rich entrepreneur that has other plans-as most bad guys do-that will essentially make himself richer, although millions may die. It involves Chris and Bryces' DNA enhanced daughter so Campbell kidnaps her and of course, Chris and Bryce are in hot pursuit. DeWanda plays a pilot for hire-think a female Han Solo-that works for Campbell or anyone else that will pay her the big bucks. There are lots of dinosaur chases with plenty of action that is fun to watch-I don't think you will doze off during the film. Although this movie wraps things up, I have heard there will be more Jurassic movies in the future. Maybe with a different cast but there will be more.<br/><br/>It's rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 26 minutes.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Reel Tunez Movie Review (6/11/22): ""Jurassic Park Dominion"".<br/><br/>Not the best J. P. Not the worst J. P. But it does bring both the initial three and most recent two Jurassic Parks together and wraps up the series.<br/><br/>It's cool bringing the original cast back together, and bringing them into the new Jurassic Park world.<br/><br/>At about 2 1/2 hours, it runs long and is full of actions, screams, and loudness. It's a fun popcorn movie.. and the effect look good (though not further improved from the last two). It's worth seeing on the big screen!<br/><br/>It does seem like they really chopped it at the last minute, almost haphazardly as a blonde villain character was on the scene, made a big presence, than just seemed to vanish.<br/><br/>I'd give it about a 6.0 out of 10. Certainly worth seeing, but also it probably won't be the best movie (or even top 5) you see this year.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is the third ""Jurassic World"" film and the sixth film in the ""Jurassic Park"" series. Directed and co-written by Colin Trevorrow (""Safety Not Guaranteed"", ""The Book of Henry""), it is a satisfactory conclusion to both the ""Park"" and ""World"" stories that should hold fans over until the inevitable future installments.<br/><br/>Four years after the events of ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"", Isla Nublar has been destroyed by a volcano and dinosaurs have now escaped into the real world. As a result, the future of the planet is in doubt since these once extinct creatures are reclaiming the Earth, making life increasingly difficult for all the other human beings and animals who are forced to co-exist alongside them. In an effort to curb this problem, a secret experiment involving more genetic engineering is underway in a secluded location, which, if successful, will allow humanity to regain its place at the top of the food chain and keep these ancient beasts under control.<br/><br/>Since the release of the first film back in 1993, the ""Jurassic Park/World"" series has had an interesting run among filmgoers. The original featured groundbreaking special effects, a great cast of memorable characters, and that iconic John Williams musical score to help cement it as one of the most iconic films of the 90s. On the other hand, all of the sequels have yielded less favourable results in terms of entertainment value, ranging from decent popcorn flicks to downright insulting to longtime fans. It seems the one that started it all has simply set the bar so high that everything else following it looks so poor in comparison. After almost three decades, the story that began so long ago finally draws to a close here in ""Jurassic World Dominion"", which ends things on a fairly acceptable note.<br/><br/>I've never been one to take the ""Jurassic Park/World"" films too seriously considering their entire premise is pretty farfetched. I mean, how seriously can you really take the concept of bringing dinosaurs back to life using mosquito blood and frog DNA? But despite that, I still find them highly entertaining for what they are, and that is watching dinosaurs wreaking havoc and exposing the hubris of humanity. I still remember being wowed by the original film as a kid and rewatching it as an adult made me realise how well it holds up today. ""Jurassic World Dominion"", which is intended to be the final film in the franchise to focus around the initial story set up in 1993, features all of this and then some, so if that's what you're craving, the film delivers just that.<br/><br/>For the most part, this film's effects look pretty good but still not as good as how they did back in the 1993 film. This is because that one used animatronics for whenever the filmmakers showed the dinosaurs up close and CGI only for when they were seen at a distance. However, since the first ""Jurassic World"" film back in 2015, the animatronics appear to have been completely discarded in favour of entirely CGI dinosaurs, which I have mixed feelings about. Sure, some of the computer-generated dinosaurs seem naturally integrated into a shot but others look so obviously added in during post-production that they stick out like a sore thumb. I understand that it's cheaper to use CGI nowadays but if these modern filmmakers truly wanted to leave an impression on viewers, then they should have at least used some animatronics wherever possible.<br/><br/>One major problem I had with this film was its bloated second act. Without giving away spoilers, all I will say is that there are three different stories going on at once, each with a different emotional feeling. For example, one moment we might see characters being chased by dinosaurs through a busy city street and then immediately after we'll see a slow paced scene of expository dialogue that feels shoehorned in there for storytelling purposes. These parts would have worked out better if they each had some kind of overarching link to one another but instead these weird shifts in tone causes the film drag at the most inopportune times. This is where I started to lose interest in the human side of the story and wished everyone would just meet up with one another already just to get things over with.<br/><br/>I do think the film made good use of the idea of humans and dinosaurs being made to co-exist with one another. Some people are shown trying to rescue the dinosaurs to take care of them while others trade them on the black market as exotic pets. There are also a number of brief but well-shot scenes of a group of triceratops and elephants walking side-by-side along the African Serengeti as well as some large pterosaurs patrolling the skies of New York City, with some even settling nests on the tops of skyscrapers. I guess I just like seeing such a jarring juxtaposition of the old and new inhabitants of the world being forced to live in the same eco-system, but at the same time being reminded that this is not the natural order of things. It's like what Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) said at the end of ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" in that ""...these creatures require our absence to survive, not our help"".<br/><br/>As a pair, both Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were fun dual protagonists as Owen and Claire, but they are rarely shown doing anything solo in this film. Though I liked that the two were a loving couple at first, I would have preferred if we could have seen them do things on their own to allow for their characters to develop individually, instead of being two inseparable halves throughout most of the film. Additionally, the young Isabella Sermon felt like she was going to waste as Maisie Lockwood, the pair's adoptive daughter. Maisie never felt like an actual fleshed-out character but rather a plot device used to advance the film forward until the climax. It's a shame because I saw potential in her back in the conclusion of ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"", but I suppose that was never meant to be.<br/><br/>It was also nice to see the original trio of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum return after almost 30 years as Dr. Alan Grant, Dr. Ellie Sattler, and Dr. Ian Malcolm, respectively. Though their reunion here is based entirely on nostalgia, their presence at least helped elevate the film above what could have been a forgettable conclusion to this long-running series. Again, like with the dinosaurs and humans, I liked the juxtaposition of the three characters from the ""Park"" films with the new ""World"" ones of Owen and Claire. There was something satisfying about watching the five of them work together to outsmart the dinosaurs with their different levels of general knowledge in their respective fields, whether it be Dr. Grant's palaeontology or Owen's ability to communicate with Velociraptors.<br/><br/>Although it's clear by now the series has run its course, I will admit that for all intents and purposes, I've enjoyed watching all six of these ""Jurassic"" films for the popcorn entertainment they are. Through the good and bad, I have nonetheless loved seeing how the filmmakers made dinosaurs live again and had them roar their deafening roars. But if you ask me, the series needs to go on a lengthy hiatus before we ever see these cretaceous creatures on the big screen again. Though knowing what a cash cow the franchise has become (like a certain sci-fi series set in a galaxy far, far away), it's only a matter of time before Universal Studios decides to milk it even further with spin-offs, prequels, video games, etc. Until then, let's just appreciate what we've got for now.<br/><br/>I rate it 6.5/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I won't go into details, this movie was incredibely underwhelming and the plot is terrible. There are some good cinematic shots and the old jp crew is back, this is all I can say positively. Every part of the movie is just a huge miss and zero satisfaction. I won't spoil it but let's just say the Giga scenes are terrible, literally acts like it's blind or just doesn't know what he wants to do.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's amazing to see the original cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World! It's like a reunion adventure movie! I was expecting a more in depth connection of those characters but seems it gave us a small treat or preview only, given the run time, they could combine more further. Nevertheless, it was a great movie to see especially to those Dino fans like me!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic Whatever is an entertaining popcorn movie. I liked the hair-raising escapes, jaws snapping , and so on. The movie must set some sort of record for near misses. The characters are all familiar and pleasant, the actors competent, and I had a good time with it. It would be a big mistake, however, to try to make sense out of the plot, because there isn't any. (It is particularly obnoxious that the villain, played by Campbell Scott, is dispatched (by the dinosaurs, of course) in almost exactly the same way.as the Wayne Knight character in the original Jurassic Park.)
Enjoying the movie - which I did, thus the six stars - requires not only a suspension of disbelief, but of intelligence, critical judgment, memory, and all sorts of other higher mental functions. Good luck.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">A fun ride and a story without legs. Hopping from here to there while thrusting the legacy characters into this frenetic whirlwind. There is potential early on, then it becomes frustrating how poorly scenes are jumbled together.<br/><br/>The Malta raptor chase is exciting. Some of the action and character drama is okay. I liked Maissie, the pilot and Malcolm's assistant as standout roles.. It was expected to see Allen, Ellie and Ian degenerated as caricatures in order to match the weaker characterizations of Trevorrow's world. The dynamic is enjoyable. But, Allen feels underused and out of place. Why is Ian such a guru? He gained more humility in TLW.. These are nitpicks, not so much flaws.<br/><br/>A lot feels inconsequential due to the ending. I am not a fan of how it ends. An image akin to our heroes on the plane smiling at one another flying away with some graceful closure is NOT what we get. I would've given 1 rating higher if it ended with a much simpler and more emotional final shot.<br/><br/>I am disheartened because JW Dominion had better potential. I hope there is an extended cut. It just felt so rushed and ended abruptly.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I am a 32 year old guy, and Jurassic Park series was a favorite of mine for a long time of my childhood. I was emotionally attached to the first series and as well loved the new ones, i.e. Jurassic world which was fabulous &amp; JW: fallen kingdom was 7/10 i'd say. So when this movie ended, I got really emotional as this was probably the last time we'd get to see the old cast together and tbh they really tried their best to save this movie. I had tears in my eyes and I felt sad even more because this movie was so bad. I never expected this to be this bad, i thought of it to be at least be better than fallen kingdom. I felt a lot of scenes were cut (very easy to observe because of poor editing)and that's the main reason we didn't get to experience the entire thing. Audiences near me were clapping and cheering at each and every moment of the last 15 minutes, but i was sitting quiet and in disbelief on how this movie was given a go with such poor editing and a bad story. This was totally unacceptable and I felt so bad. I really hope that they will release an extended version or a director cut later on. I felt good about the fact that at least 60% of the regular audience in my theatre happened to enjoy this one, they didn't seem to be a fan of the series or something, but they loved watching dinosaurs and they cheered on all the good scenes( which in my eyes weren't that good because they made the dinosaurs look dumb and slow in this movie), so I'm happy that at least not everyone was in the same boat as me. This movie deserved so much more!! I wish I could've been on the happy side. :(</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">This review will likely be drowned by an influx of uncritical ""I liked it"" reviews. I don't really care. I feel like I ought to put my thoughts out here.<br/><br/>I'd say if you really want to, go see it and form your own opinion. I don't really care either way.<br/><br/>As a film Jurassic World Dominion is at least competently shot and coherent throughout unlike its predecessor Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. However...
As far as writing, pacing, and characters go, it's not particularly great. A large portion of the film could be better allocated. Entire scenes could either be reworked or all-out removed. The two main plotlines barely connect (and the Locusts one could be scrapped altogether) and the inclusion of the original film's cast felt like pandering and nostalgia bait (something highlighted by the inexplicable fanservice that is the romance between Sattler and Grant).<br/><br/>The animals.<br/><br/>Some creatures barely matter, such as Moros and Dimetrodon, and those who do matter are often shafted in favour of new creatures which show up, do a thing, and then never come back again. Scenes like those involving the Pyroraptor could be reworked to make the animal more important instead of leaving it as yet another dromaeosaur to throw onto the 'Jurassic' pile. Beta, Blue's parthenogenic baby, is forgotten about for most of the film until at some point she becomes relevant again.<br/><br/>The characters.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned the main thing of what I disliked about Sattler/Grant, but there's also the fact that Grant as a character feels limp. He's a very passive character. Things just sort of happen to him instead of them happening from his own initiative like in the original JP. Maisie's personal arc is resolved, so that's nice, but her being a clone only ever comes up in relevance to that. By the end of the film it's likely that she will STILL have to stay in hiding, that was never closed off or anything like that. The original cast being present was also limp. They were functionally interchangeable with other, non-returning characters, which is not what you want your legacy cast to feel like especially not in a film like this.<br/><br/>Pacing.<br/><br/>Pacing is mentioned in my other paragraphs, but to get more into it: by removing or reallocating scenes you could get rid of the very ""go to the place, do the thing"" nature of this film. Things happen and people go to places but it never feels like these places are actually important. They could be interchanged with any other and I don't believe specific locales really mattered.<br/><br/>The thing this film has going for it is that it is, in fact, NOT Fallen Kingdom. FK was a worse film because it tried to be multiple films at once. This one almost over-corrected. It really goes without saying that while this isn't *the worst* Jurassic sequel, it most certainly isn't the best either. I won't even get into why I think Universal is quite a scummy company, cos I'll be here all night. Please be critical of the films you see and analyse them. You might even find things you'd never seen before.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love Jurassic Park franchise. I know this lore very well. But this movie was bad. Propably the worst jp movie. Plots are great but they did not work in this movie. Biosyn isn't necessary. Jw Dominion should about blackmarket of dinosaurs. Btw new dinosaurs look ugly. Atrociraptors, Giganotosaurus, Pyroraptor and Therizinosaurus are not good. I love Moros and Quetzalcoatlus but they don't have enough scenes. Script and editing was bad. The final scenes are not make any sense without the prologue. Btw I hate the Dimetrodon model. It was very ugly. Dimetrodon was a nice synapsid walks and sleeps all day. It is swimming now like a spinosaurus. Shame.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I loved Michael Chrichton's books and the Jurassic Park series, and was in awe while watching Jurassic World and the first half of fallen kingdom. Some of the sequences are so memorable that I have rewatched the movies many times.<br/><br/>But the Dominion doesn't have any meaning. There is no resolution for what the main question raised in the ending of the last movie- whether mankind can coexist with dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Most of the sequences such as the Malta one, Claire ejecting from the plane thinking that wud be safer when they show her to be in more danger than the other two together, dodgson stopping their escape in the train and exposing his asset to dinosaurs in the mines, and Grant, Sattler and Malcolm acting so secretive to steal the DNA when you can't understand what wud happen if Dodgson caught them.<br/><br/>Finally, apart from seeing Blue in the wild, none of the dinosaurs made any impact other than being props. It cud have been any creatures other than dinosaurs chasing these guys, and it would have made no difference.<br/><br/>Finally, there was no scope for Chris Pratt in the movie to shine through.<br/><br/>Disappointing script and useless antagonist- everything seemed contrived and unnatural; I still don't get why Claire fell into a rainforest while the other two fell on a frozen lake and still found Claire later. And what were locusts doing in a dinosaur movie????</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is everything I expected it to be: loud, dumb, and over the top action packed. I was neutral about this movie, it's so bad that it's almost good. What definitely worked for this movie was bringing back characters from the original films. I enjoyed seeing Neil and Dern along side Dallas and Pratt as well as the newcomers, Wise and Athie. However, a lot didn't work, like the storyline. It's generic and I expected much more. The dinosaurs are almost an after thought in this storyline, placed second to gigantic locusts (yes, silly, I know). Not horrible, but wasted opportunity. I would have preferred the movie expanding on humans living with dinosaurs in a modern world and exploring the moral and ethical debates that go along with it. It briefly touched on that but didn't dive in before creating some bogus plot about a corporation out to disrupt the food chain. Could have had some thought provoking yet terrifying and majestic scenes instead of the over utilized ""evil corporation tries to take over the world"" plot.</div>

I had good expectations from this legacy franchise especially Jurassic World 1 was so much entertaining. Film focuses more on humans and locusts than Dinosaurs. There is little continuity in the film, script is clueless. First 45 minutes are terribly wrong with no tense moments. Iconic Jurassic music theme plays only once in the entire movie when the legacy character makes entry in the film. The great T-Rex has very little screen time.<br/><br/>Having said, Jurassic models and special effects are good and it feels real. Acting is good. Return of main characters from the original film is soothing. I wish they had done justice to the dinasours and audience by not writing so poor script. I give film 5 stars for failing the expectations from great Jurassic Kingdom.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am trying to think how did the directors rationalize the scene where Clair was being chased by the raptors and she was out running them at probably 12 km/h speed and on the other hand Owen was on a bike, riding at 80 to 90 kms/h speed and the raptors matched that too. So were the raptors chasing Clair slower or there's no logic in this film?<br/><br/>Also how is it that the Mantis managed to fly for a few miles after they were incinerated so much?<br/><br/>Are the directors in Hollywood assuming that people are stupid or watching too many bollywood movies?</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had my hopes relatively low after seeing the review scores. And I have to say, I loved almost everything about the first half! Alan and Ellie getting up to their shenanigans, Malcom making the movie better just by opening his mouth and talking. And then the second half started. Oh boy, was it boring. It was basically characters who you knew would live because some scenes from the trailer still hadn't happened with them in it running away from stuff. And when said scenes from the trailer were over and the characters FINALLY weren't safe anymore... the movie was done. I'm not kidding. I counted 5 deaths in this film, just as many as in JP 1. The difference however is that in JP 1, all deaths meant something because we got to know the characters before they died. In this movie it's 4 no-names and Dodgeson, who I also never cared about. Also they didn't really bring the franchise to a close, they just finished Wu's character-arc. I will say that it's an alright movie and the performances (especially Jeff Goldblum and B. D. Wong) were good. But overall, I'm not happy. It wasn't bad, but it was just really disappointing as what is basically meant to be a series finale. So it's alright, it just underdelivered.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Before I saw this film I had a feeling it was going to be the worst one of the new trilogy and I was correct. The first one was great. This movie was very erratic, too much action and no plot. They could have closed this franchise out the right way, but missed the mark significantly. The locusts being the focus of the film was absolutely ridiculous. They had nothing to do with the dinosaurs themselves. I thought I came to see Jurassic Park? They literally made a movie about locusts eating crops and decided to add dinosaurs in the mix. It was laughable. I however did enjoy seeing the original cast back, but they couldn't save this stinker. Definitely a one time watch on demand. Also, the movie was extremely loud for no reason. Making the movie louder doesn't drown out the abysmal plot.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Remember when Ian Malcolm waved the flare to get the T-Rex's attention? This sequel does. Remember when they handed out walkie-talkies in the bunker in the first film before splitting up? This sequel does.<br/><br/>Unbearable nostalgia baiting and truly awful writing/editing/directing are the main problems with this film. The soundtrack is also notably bad. The actors are not to blame for this one. They all did a great job with what they had to work with.<br/><br/>This didn't even feel like a Jurassic movie for a lot of the runtime. I felt like I was watching a globe-trotting James Bond film with an evil super villain.<br/><br/>It's not quite Rise of Skywalker level bad, but it's definitely the worst film in the Jurassic series.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">A lot of money went into this movie, and it shows... too much. Rather than allowing you to form an emotional connection with any character (or dinosaur), it's never-ending action sequences and predictable characters and interactions. It honestly felt more like Fast and the Furious or Mission Impossible than Jurassic Park or Jurassic World. I would even suggest that the dinosaurs added very little to the movie. It would have been a better movie without them.<br/><br/>My 7-year old daughter, who loved Jurassic Park, Lost World, and Jurassic World, along with the Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous TV show, asked us halfway through the movie if we could leave, which she has never done before, and leave we did.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Another baffling entry in the Jurassic Park sequel franchise. A big point of consternation with the movie, is the fact that the writing as well as the production seem to be done by committee. There are a couple of scenes that are absolutely breathtaking and poignant while some scenes, the majority, seem to be have written and shot for the CW or a weirdo app like Pluto or something.<br/><br/>It is really quite bad. I spent a lot of time wondering what went wrong, until I looked at the end credits and there it was, screenplay by Emily Carmichael (No relation). Emily is a writer, the likes of which, I refer to as The Destroyer of Worlds. These are writers who weasel onto a sequel project and completely upend what made earlier entries in a property or franchise work.<br/><br/>The truth is, the people who made the movie clearly have no idea what they are doing. It's almost as if the filmmakers and crew were winging it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately when you look further into the credits, that seems to be the case.<br/><br/>This is a hundred million dollar student film, basically. There are dinosaurs I guess, and nobody is running up a mountain in high heels, there's actually a plot point where they zoom in on Claire's feet to show that indeed she is not wearing high heels this time.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The change to portraying the dinosaurs as monsters rather than animals is the biggest transgression of the sequels as it fundamentally changes the audience's point of view. In JP1 &amp; 2 you're not privy to anything the characters aren't; you're going through the experience WITH them. That's a deliberate, important creative decision by Spielberg. From JP3 onwards you're on the side of the ""puppeteers"", to use a timely comparison. You're now (as a viewer) more omniscient, instead of sympathetic, it's criminal really<br/><br/>Additionally, Dominion was never going to be dinosaurs battling humans in New York City. It was something that, would honour Crichton's work a little bit more. I don't think he ever wrote a fantasy book.<br/><br/>I think the he challenge for Trevorrow was getting to a place where the dinosaurs will be in this somewhat confined space, and obviously, still making sure all hell broke loose.<br/><br/>For me, it's the second half of the movie when they started to converge in that environment. It may have been just because I did grow up on ""Jurassic Park,"" but each of these films rely on the humans not being able to just call an Uber and get out of there.<br/><br/>They have to be trapped in a confined space in order for the kind of sequences that these movies thrive on to exist. I also felt like we've been taken the on a journey that has a lot of new stuff in it in the first half. It's a lot of new ideas and new sequences. I felt, as we got toward the end of this meal that we'd been served, it was important to bring out some comfort dishes, and make sure that, as the characters collided with the ""Jurassic Park"" characters, it really felt like ""Jurassic Park.""</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was quite possibly the biggest money grab since Caddyshack 2. Just when you thought Jurassic Park Lost World was the biggest pile of stegosaurus dung ever created, the franchise said ""wait, hold my beer"". Seriously the best part of this movie was the slime that ran down the T-Rexs neck after eating a deer. The not so subtle nods to the original were cool but came off stronger than a frat boy with a bottle of Jack Daniels at a college kegger. Like I said thank God they served beer or otherwise I'd have given it a 1 star. RIP Jurassic Park.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I absolutely loved it. It was great to see Lewis Dodgson as the main villain of Jurassic world dominion. It all connected to both novels . Dodgson was using locusts for mutation and Henry wu knew that was gonna cause real chaos all over the world. And Dodgson knew dr grant Ellie and Ian malcom we're gonna figure out what Dodgson was really planning. And I knew Dodgson was more important to the story . Cause he knew Masie was the daughter of Charlotte Lockwood who knew John hammond after dr wu was creating the dinosaurs on site b . After nedry shut the power down on nublar everything changed . But after all the dinosaurs went to the mainland Dodgson hired Ed mills and Ken to bring the dinosaurs to him . And after Dodgson failed all chaos broke lose again .<br/><br/>Thank you Crichton.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Duration: Too long.<br/><br/>Characters: Bland. Characters' actions make absolutely no sense, not only the movie fails to explain the motives behind some major decisions but also makes them do things that are contradictory to what we already know about them.<br/><br/>Script: Horrible. HORRIBLE. At one point a male character literally decided ALL BY himself to throw his wife out of the plane with a parachute into the area infested with all kinds of flying and running dangerous dinosaurs. You know what he said when he did that? ""You are a mum."" I would have rather stayed on the about to crush plane. And either ways, it was her call to make. Not his.<br/><br/>The key take away: Dinosaurs are fast, dangerous unstoppable beasts that can be used as targeted weapons. Dinosaurs kill people and other animals like foxes and deers and threaten to wipe out modern ecosystem. But also, they are gentle living things, they have deep feelings and understand English and the expression of gratitude. The must be protected because the main characters decide that it's a morally right thing to do and therefore we must support it.<br/><br/>The concepts of forced philosophy of ✨coexisting✨ (Rainbow and butterflies and castle emojis here) is absolutely insane. Its mind numbingly stupid and naive.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">A good ride for the last of the latest trilogy,l found the long running time didnt go against it.the two worlds of dinosaurs and our own animals living together side by side,plus the old guard of the earlier films mashing together with the younger group makes for an exciting mix.as ever the special effects are top notch but I'm afraid now that audiences have become complacent about such things.another number one film that doesn't own its merit to DC or marvel.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The story doesn't make any sense. Too much bland and unnecessary long runtime. It's a just short 15 min movie. The movie just looped the same 15 min again and again in different places. Please showcase the hand of Chris Patt in the museum to stop tsunamis and any upcoming diseases. Just show the hand and it will automatically solve all the problems.<br/><br/>The whole movie wasn't about dinosaurs, it's all about the stupid hand of Chris Patt.<br/><br/>The writer is confused about what to write for the movie! Completely disaster. Jurassic Park should stop and make the movie named "" The problem Solver hand"".</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The movie is just a money making exercise that is so poorly made that I considered walking out. It's just the same formula regurgitated again and again. Surely they can't bring another one out after this one? It's overcooked, it's done.<br/><br/>The movie has separated moviegoers from their hard earned cash by promising nostalgia. The problem is it is as though the moviemakers thought simply having the old cast in the movie would be enough and no further effort would be required. The old cast in this movie are woody, clunky and you never really make any connection with them. The execution of this movie is poor and acting level (think Sharknado level acting)<br/><br/>I'm not someone who gets bored easy but this movie started sooooooo slow. Go see it if you don't believe me. You could have left the first 30mins on the cutting room floor and you would be better for it.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure what I watched it was that bad. I closed my eyes a few times to zone out for a bit. I'm just really shocked at the empty void that this movie is, it's like the studio knew they would make money anyway so they hurriedly wrote the script on a napkin. I don't know if I'm seeing it right but it seems to steal ideas from the Star Wars Cantina, Han Solo character in the female pilot, Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Go see it if you want a mind numbing cinema experience.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I mean this film is bad. It is really bad. The non stop cheap imitation of John Williams that attacks you without a give up for about an hour. Jumping between different main char groups as if some amazing plot foreshadowing is coming. Ellie and Dr Grant clearly seem like they do not want to even be in the film. They are abysmal. For some reason they meet up and after some locust DNA or something. These locusts catch on fire at some point and start reigning Napalm down on people?<br/><br/>The raptor CGI is abysmal and dinosaurs don't really exist until about an hour and a half into the film and even then it does not make sense.<br/><br/>But by god....there is some super duel at the end between a T Rex and super lab dino, because of course T Rex has an affiliation with all our 9 cast? It gets better though because all dinos feel an affiliation and kill super lab dino to save humans.<br/><br/>We also have. Claire that can jump from building to building (without spiderman's web) and out run raptors. Chris Pratt and his Aide ripped out a dinosaurs throat at some point to save Claire? I haven't even touched the surface about how absurd an inexplicable each scene was. Of course a Quetzalcoatlas decides his diet is now large chunks of metal in the sky?<br/><br/>3 stars instead of 1 because Jeff Goldblum (within his circa 10 mins of screen time) demonstrated some signs of acting?<br/><br/>This is bad.... I mean real bad.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just got home from seeing this with my son, In all honesty it isn't a bad film. Jurassic Park and Jurassic World are far better though. Story isn't to bad, Chris Pratt, and Brice Dallas Howard are awesome yet again but what was amazing was seeing Sam Neil, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum together again.</div>

</div>
<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I am just going to start this review off by stating this film is getting beyond too much hate. In fact a huge amount of the critiques are unfounded, inaccurate or hyprocritical. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it great? Maybe not. Is it bad or terrible, or as offensive as these 1/10 reviews would have you believe? No. It's good. Sure it has flaws, it definitely ain't perfect.<br/><br/>However from a die hard super fan, who's seen all the films countless times, and the original Jurassic Park being my all time favourite, what I can say is that it was not anywhere close to what the critics or reviews would have you believe.<br/><br/>Before I get into the rest, let me state this. The Rise of Skywalker has lines like ""They fly now!"" and somehow Palpatine has returned! IMDb rating? 6.5/10. Furious 7 has Dwayne Johnson rip a minigun off a drone and use it manually after driving a ambulance off a bridge to crash it. Paul Walker also drives a car through three sky scrapers. IMDB rating? 7.3/10. Black Panther, Shang Chi and numerous other MCU films have legit PS2 level CGI...did anyone see the opening sequence to Doctor Strange 2? Yep, 7.3/10, 7.4/10 &amp; 7.3/10 respectively for those films.<br/><br/>This film is currently sitting at 6/10 with only 10k votes, and IMDb tends to see things only drop. So my point is, does this film deserve all this hate, especially when you compare it to other films rated here? Well, no, it quite frankly is just unfair how many vague, brainless and cynical 1/10, 2/10 and 3/10 reviews are here. You don't have to like the film, but review fairly. This film, is at worst, mediocre. But I believe it's far more than that, both as a JP fan but also just as a crafted film.<br/><br/>No Way Home, let's use that for comparison. Decent acting? Check. A long run time, fairly messy, yet fun script and story? Check. Some humor? Check. References and callbacks? Check. Return of some iconic characters, fan service and world building? Check. A decent score that probably uses a lot of old tracks from prior films? Check. Good cinematography? Check. Good CGI and practical effects?<br/><br/>No, I'd say NWH is lacking there. And you know what? Dominion is near identical in every single category! Yet...NWH has 8.3/10 and Dominion has 6/10. You see the pattern here? This film is copping ridiculous amounts of hate. You don't have to be an award winning classic, an indie film or a Comic Book movie to be good.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion is completely faithful and respectful to the legacy of all the films, the franchise itself and Michael Critchon's work.<br/><br/>It has beautiful cinematography, amazing CGI and awesome use of practical effects. It builds on the world and lore, and Giacchion's score is awesome as always. Grant feels like Grant. Ellie feels like Ellie. Malcolm feels like Malcolm. Owen and Claire are better than they've been, and Maisie (clone girl) is handled really well. The discourse around human cloning and the locust are straight out of Michael Critchon's work - Timeline, Micro, Westworld, Jurassic Park. Man playing god, manipulating nature and corporate greed.<br/><br/>Dominion puts the dinosaurs back a seat and focuses on the humans - yet people complain? Everyone praises the minimal use of the dinosaurs in the original, and states it's about man's misuse of technology and character arcs, whether it be Alan or Hammond. This film does the same. Heck they even got Dogdson back, just like the novels!<br/><br/>Does this film feature some wonky dialogue, some cheesy moments and plot conveniance? Sure. But it's not pure garbage.<br/><br/>It's staggering how many people use the word ""dumb"". Yet...where is this film dumb? Like where, seriously? I LOVE the other films, but they for sure have dumb moments or moments where logic gone. But this film surprisingly doesn't! Every decision, whether it be by Owen, or Claire or Grant or whoever, is the logical choice. There's not even any suspend your belief stunts or plot armor. The characters just genuinely navigate the locations well. No dumb dino prices, no militarised hybrids, no stupid decisions leading to chaos.<br/><br/>Heck people said they want less trained raptors and Blue, less ""Fast &amp; Furious over the top action"", less Rexy saving the day, and more human content/character work.<br/><br/>Well guess what? They gave us that. It's funny we have people saying too much dinosaurs then people saying not enough dinosaurs.<br/><br/>What happened to being able to enjoy a summer block buster? This film is fun, enjoyable, nostalgic and true to it's roots. Half the negative reviews here don't even state any examples or evidence, they're just the typical ""Hollywood bad"" or ""sequel bad"". Don't get me wrong, I've hated plenty of films, but this film surely isn't any bit close to the current rating.<br/><br/>My only real major gripes is despite the long run time and a huge cast, there weren't enough casualties (even for side characters) and that the prologue should've been kept to open the film.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, please rate fairly, please don't be discouraged by reviews, and please form your own opinion. Love it? Great! Meh? Great! Hate it? Great! But don't just jump on the band wagon and don't straight up lie or pretend there's issues without evidence.<br/><br/>My final score is, as a fan 9/10, as a film 7.5/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am a huge Jurassic Park fan, and the 1st movie was and always will be one of my favorite movies that I've ever seen in theaters.<br/><br/>All these new dinosaur species but not enough present on screen.<br/><br/>Whenever action starts it goes by so quickly...<br/><br/>I think Jurassic World movies should be more about dinosaurs, not about human characters and their relationships...<br/><br/>Looks like Hollywood is determined to ruin every single 80s and 90s cult movie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honestly disappointed. I went in with low expectations, but this movie didn't even meet them. Yes, the dinosaurs were pretty cool and had great animation. It is not good enough to save the atrocious plot of this movie. I was ready for the movie to be over an hour in and felt bored most of the movie. All of the tension was forced and it was so predictable! To the point where I could count down from three to my wife to predict a larger dinosaur would pop out. I'm thankful that this movie brought my wife and I closer over our shared laughter at the ridiculous plot. I won't see these movies in theater any longer, I'm so glad it was free.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">After the ending of the last film it left me and I'm sure everyone else very excited to see what the action will be like when the dinosaurs will roam the planet.

<div class=""text show-more__control"">There are obviously some errors in the script (story), I don't doubt that, but we have a lot going on with the dinosaurs and that's what's the most important thing at the end of the day. The fact that the old characters came back isn't all that innovative, but it's a good concoction in the trilogy. The movie does keep you gripped in certain scenes, so it's definitely a good movie.<br/><br/>It might be a bit too predictable at times, but is that really all that important? I think this is a very very good addition to the trilogy that raises the bar! I can therefore recommend it for all dinosaur fans out there.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie opens with a attack by a marine dinosaur on a fisherman's catch in the Bering Sea off Alaska then we move to snow covered mountains where dinosaurs are roaming around. In snow. Snow. I don't mean to nitpick but dinosaurs are cold-blooded reptiles who were killed off by the cold, right? All the other movies were set in warm, tropical locations because they're dinosaurs. Watching a fur-less brontosaurus walk through snowdrifts was absolutely silly. Then yes, you have the expected and predictable set pieces. We see the same bits from ""nobody move"" to the dinosaur spinning the car we've seen in previous movies. The same Rex vs big monster du jour. Other than getting to see the characters together and a possibly satisfying relationship issue this really didn't hit on any level. If you've seen the previous movies then you've seen every scene in this one, with better writing, plot, dialog and consistency. In the original, we let slide that the velociraptors were really the size of turkeys because they were fun and interesting. The things they put in this one make little sense and honestly are just silly. We have the obligatory ""this is the real biggest apex predator, not the one we introduced in the last movie"" creature along with something that looks like it came out of the muppet Dark Crystal movie. If you can get cheap tickets and really want to ""complete the set"" then go see this. Otherwise, wait until it's on tv in 9 months.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">My family and I have been Jurassic fans a long time and have enjoyed each film in the franchise in different ways, just having a good time with the continuing narrative. It's fun, it's thrilling, it's scary as a franchise, sometimes it's even heartbreaking. We saw this today and were thrilled to have one more good, long adventure as the series comes to a close. Sure, people are going to pick apart every little thing or be sour, but it was a truly fun summer movie and great farewell to the world of Jurassic films. It was worth the 2 and a half hours, my kids loved it, and I thought it was a terrific experience. Plus, we get to see all our beloved main characters all together. Definitely go see it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Look no Jurassic park/world movies will ever live up to the first film and the book to that matter. But the franchise is still fun kids and adults love to see the new dinosaurs on screen and I hope it carries on. There are no other franchises doing Dino movies so I personally hope to see some more.<br/><br/>This blends cast from old to new great the film moves at good pace and it's entertaining. Just sit back and enjoy it!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a Jurassic Park movie franchise fans, I am really dissapointed with the latest sequel ""Jurassic World Dominion"". This movie can't satisfied the fans, as well as the previous "" Fallen Kingdom"" which also didn't have a good stories to continue the franchise. Another intrict with the BIOSYN &amp; their new researches, conflicts with the smuglers and action with super agent style scenes were bored. The storyline way more and more deviated from the original story. If this sequel is really the closing movie of the franchise, then the movie need to be considered for another sequel or prequel without any action of gunshooting scenes whatsoever.</div>

Why is it the Hollywood trend appears to be finding the balance of the better the special effects, the sillier the story.<br/><br/>This one takes the biscuit. Throw in the compulsory wonderful /genius blm advert 'characters' to even further break down the fourth wall and basically it's only worth watching for the (albeit impressive) effects so bring your eyeballs but leave your brains at home.<br/><br/>Was nice to wear the 3D specs again, although nothing really jumped out at me.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Dinosaurs partly live alongside humans around the world, but an extinct giant swarm of locust mysteriously re-emerge threatening the worlds food supply and ecological system. After a kidnapping two groups cross paths while trying to put things right.<br/><br/>Director Colin Trevorrow offers a visually slick outing and even with its lengthy run time moves it along at a fast pace with some impressive staging.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast are great, even if the script is more focused on the espionage-like sets up. It includes Jurassic World favourites Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Isabella Sermon along with Jurassic Park's Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum. BD Wong also returns bridging the to trilogies as well as a few familiar faces from Fallen Kingdom and World. DeWanda Wise is particularly notable even if the character feels more from a James Bond or a Mission Impossible film.<br/><br/>It should be said that's it's great to see Dern, Goldblum and Neill reprise their roles appearing together for the first time since the 1993 film. However, Emily Carmichael and Colin Trevorrow's dialogue is spread a little thin. The main issue with Derek Connolly and Trevorrow story is the same issue as its predecessor, once you move them away from the West World-like Jurassic park setting or confines of a small Island the fear and intrigue is diluted. It 'jumped shark' with human cloning and even more so in Dominion especially durning the Malta underground dealing shenanigans. Unfortunately, it's simply too outlandish and over the top, rather than a dino-adventure, it's more messy spy thriller with dinosaurs.<br/><br/>There's wonderful cinematography from
John Schwartzman, the effects are also impressive, the action is complimented by Michael Giacchino's music and John Williams themes. It's nice that they used the character of Dodgson, here played by Campbell Scott replacing Cameron Thor from Jurassic Park (1993). Both the Dr. Ellie Sattler and Dr. Alan Grant get fitting closure. Also we finally see what happened to the canister lost by Dennis Nedry in the original.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a wonderfully looking fun film, jam packed with dinosaur hi-jinx and show downs. But it just lacks the simplicity, also the emotional weight of the original trilogy; and Jurassic World to some extent. It's just not the direction maybe some viewers wanted it to go, to change the taste of Coca-cola means you have to change the recipe; and over the last two films they changed the taste of Coca-cola. Recommended with cola caution.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">LIKES:
The Comedy: The Jurassic Park series has always had some string of comedy sprinkled in the darker world of the survival pictures. Dominion goes a little more into this realm, working to make it very funny and sometimes in the modern style of more is better. Pratt and Goldblum are the primary haulers of the comedy, while the other characters sneak their own levels of laughs into the mix. Yet my favorite styles were some of the dinosaur moments and how the managed to make several of them have a little more human side and deliver that comedic punch to rock our worlds. Though forced a bit at times, the comedy really is decently done and feels back to being natural and well-placed like the first movies.<br/><br/>Lots of Dinosaurs: It's a movie about dinosaurs and well you get dinosaurs... where others have shown their cards and given you a few species to enjoy and get glimpses of, Dominion really makes this supposed final act, have all the dinosaurs that you could want in this short run time. While some of them are the classic monsters you remember, there are other species from various eras that arise from the shadows and most of them feel just as sinister and destructive as you hope for in this series. So for those tired of the typical thunder lizards, you'll be in for a treat at the variety the movie brought with it.<br/><br/>The Musical Score: Hands down another great lineage to this movie, the musical score is certainly one that still gives me goosebumps when I hear it boom over the speakers. Like the sound editing that brings the roars to life, the sixth part of the saga has the powerful orchestra work to add emotion to the scene and pull you into the full experience. Softer tones accompany or proceed the pounding orchestra blast that this series does super well. It's part of the movie theater experience worthy tone of this movie series and one of my favorite parts of the movie.<br/><br/>The Pace: While certainly not the target pace of the first film, Dominion manages to still keep the action going and keep things moving. For all the story elements this movie juggled, it did not do a half-bad job for me in them working it to remain entertaining. From the opening moments that sum up the events before to getting into the Dinosaur action and solutions, it really just keeps a steady pace without dawdling too much on the truth. Again, the result is an entertaining adventure for fans of the series to enjoy and just get more Dinosaur carnage and rampaging on the screen.<br/><br/>The Acting: While certainly not the most unique or Oscar worthy in terms of roles and performances, the movie's repertoire of actors and actresses accomplishes the fun I like to see in these movies. Pratt is Pratt, he's goofy, but action hero epic, as he does his best to tame the primitive and fearsome beasts that are on the screen. He's the typical hero role we've come to love in him, and he has some great moves to finish this series off. Howard is probably the one with the most dynamic range in this film, her character getting a lot more time and scenarios than other characters at this time. As a result, she accomplished much in her character's growth and ability, really selling the emotions for the most part and giving me more to like about Claire while avoiding going too far down the stoic warrior path. As for Dern, she's a master of her trade, and I liked the new Ellie that was still the same quality components we got in number one, but still adding some new qualities that shows what she has been doing for the last three decades. As for the rest of the group, they do a great job with the parts handed and there are too many to go through given how loaded the film is. However, the summary is: Neal is great if a bit underutilized, Sermon is funny and replays the role quite well, Wise is tough, funny, and reminiscent of the American pilot trope from Spielberg films, while Goldblum accomplishes much in that same steal the show moment you love.<br/><br/>The Character Use: While nowhere near perfect, Dominion does a better job than I intended of keeping the cast involved in the entire film, at least the human cast. With all sorts of characters to try and pull into one final act, you have a lot of stories, actors, and teams to try and keep ingrained in the tale. Old cast may not be the most involved at times, but hit at the moments that matter and give the loyal fans everything they need to wrap up this portion of the Jurassic World series, including laughs and a few tropes that you might be wanting to see. As for the new ones this part of the series, they get a lot more of the time and again accomplish the goal of expanding the story, whilst still being fun avatars to live through in this world.<br/><br/>The Chase Scene/Action At Times: The trailers showed an exciting scene of dinosaurs and bikes, and you know what... it accomplished it big time. I loved the race through the streets, a feeling of Mission Impossible meeting Dinos as they raced for survival in this CGI world. I absolutely loved this moment and felt it was the highlight of the action for this movie and the true climactic experience, if not a little cheesy at times. Other action scenes felt very part of the world, and there is a few big beast fights that you'll be wanting to see that really have some fun qualities to them, including one epic finish. As such, the action does accomplish its role for this series and should have the extreme fanatics stomping their feet in delight.<br/><br/>The Graphics: By far, the ability of studios to make dinosaurs come to life is still something that, to quote Laura Dern, ""you never get used to!"". For me, I love seeing the beasts come to life, finding the balance between computer graphic use and animatronics to bring these ancient creatures back to life. With modern technology, the computer work has never looked better in textures and stationary shots, while the robots are still impressive, but a little more artificial at times, though still doing a fantastic job of making them pop off the screen.<br/><br/>The Action At Times: Again, more beasts and humans, means a bit more of other qualities being scattered and the action is again one of those moments. Prior to the new trilogy, Jurassic Park's action was mostly about survival in the world of the largest carnivores. While some of that does exist, Dominion seems to have diluted most of it to the modern day action, leading to some great moments mentioned above, but also weaker elements you had hoped would be a bit more intense in the long run. The result is less intense action moments and feel like there are less stakes to be had.<br/><br/>The Subplots: Characters have to have arcs and backgrounds to be engaging right? Well, Jurassic World: Dominion does have that, only with so many characters in the mix they are a little diluted and bland. Both old and new have things they can certainly pursue, but sadly don't do well with everybody on the screen. The new pilot who lives life dangerously, Malcolm's story over the last two decades of what's happened with him, even Ellie to an extent all feel very simplistic given what it could have been. It's not horrible, and checks the box for complete, but for those invested in the characters, don't expect the most thought out character plots for others.<br/><br/>The Main Story: By far the weaker of the tales, was indeed the story of Jurassic World Dominion. Painting a very broad stroke and keeping all the characters in it, this movie is not quite the focused feature the others have been. While most merely just want a survival film filled with dinosaurs and more dinosaurs, others again want to be engaged with the film. Again, for me, this film diluted both and the great overarching story is a little more political story than actually engaging feature. The villain is simplified and boring, the solutions to the problems almost as dry and uncreative, as they simply work through things. Throw in the predictability, the lack of suspense, and the statistical probability of what is going to happen and the plot becomes less impressive in favor of the flash in a pan gimmick.<br/><br/>The Lack of Suspense and Terror: By far, the lack of suspense and terror is what I was missing in this film. Jurassic World has lost so much of the thing that drew us into the first series, the intensity of surviving the next encounter and how they got out, racking us with terror as the fake monsters tried to tear their way to food. For me, that feeling has been gone since number three, replaced with an almost action/drama feel that while it has it's good parts, is still not the same edge it once had. I did not find myself talking to the screen encouraging them to go, go, go like I once did and that was a bit sad for me really. It was this lack of intensity that II think was the weakest component of the movie and the lack of intensity is the component that really made the movie drawl in my case.<br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>The supposed last installment of the great dinosaur movie was entertaining and fun, with the effects being the main thing to experience in theater. It juggles the cast well, makes for a fun use of multiple dinosaur species, and breaks open the music and technology to craft the world. It handles the cast decently well and keeps that engaging pace you want in a movie like this, devoid of any complex plot of processing. However, even the simple adventure like that lacks the bite of the original series, putting almost too much in one film that it spreads the quality across the two-hours unevenly and in many ways less than the potential it had. The biggest disappointment with me was in fact the lack of terror and suspense, this component almost washed out entirely given the predictability of the tale. So, factoring that in my scores of the movie are:<br/><br/>Action/Adventure/sci-fi: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Let's start with the positives..... It was really good to see original cast members back, especially Jeff Goldblum.<br/><br/>But that's about it I'm afraid.<br/><br/>All the returning cast did was remind me how good Jurassic Park was &amp; how poor pretty much every sequel has been in comparison, with Dominion reaching new lows.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt only works with a snappy, humour filled dialogue, &amp; there's none of that here.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard spends most of the film under a blanket to disguise all the weight she's put on since the first film &amp; subsequent Disney pay check meals out. This makes her outrunning a raptor even more ridiculous!<br/><br/>I wanted the cloned, sulky kid to get eaten by a dinosaur, but here we have the real problem, there's just not enough dinosaurs!<br/><br/>Art imitates art here. They give us bigger dinosaurs to impress us but ultimately who cares when the plot is so laughably bad?<br/><br/>This could have been the epic conclusion we hoped for. Dinosaurs running amok in big cities &amp; towns in an apocalyptic stand off with humans.<br/><br/>What did we get....<br/><br/>Giant locusts &amp; a really tall ostrich in need of a manicure.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Is there no such thing as an editing department anymore? This movie was just trying to do way too much. It felt like, to save time, they cut out parts of the story, rather than cutting out some of the big effects scenes that all seem to be competing against themselves for attention. For a theater movie, this is a one star movie. If I would've just watched it at home, it would probably be a 4 star movie. Just not worth the theater price.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">My expectations for this film were medium to low based on how the last film went. While I was hoping for something big, bold, exciting, and new. I got nothing but a story that felt rehashed with characters that didn't really need a comeback (granted it was nice to see them) with a villain that was just as annoying as the last one.<br/><br/>On the surface this film looks spectacular, but that's all it is. Looks. The dinosaurs are stunning, as they meander along their surroundings which have rich detail. The dino battles are spectacular, as well.<br/><br/>But for all that this film has no oomph. The characters are bland, new and old, as they go through the motions. Unlike the previous two I didn't feel very emotional by the end. I didn't feel the need to shred a tear as there was no true bond amongst characters. Like I said above. The story just wasn't intriguing enough. Instead of focusing on a few topics. I felt there were multiple focuses they tried to attack that didn't mesh well and they didn't fit in too well into the incredibly long runtime.<br/><br/>I don't know where they plan to go next if they even plan to go anywhere, but the ending was so disappointing, it felt like a betrayal to all main characters, new and old, if this was truly the end.<br/><br/>Overall, there was much to be desired. While IMAX was cool to see this film in. It felt like a waste. If you're considering seeing this film. Wait for a cheap night if you're theatre offers one.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. If it does help. Please consider leaving a like, and giving me a follow if you don't already.<br/><br/>Until next time.... Enjoy the show!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Jurassic Park movies used to be about cracking boundaries, whether that was by scientifically bringing back dinosaurs, or showing us that we can enjoy a movie about monsters eating people whilst still feeling small and real and have that out of worldly feeling. I'm afraid in this instalment, the only new ground being struck is the fact that we see all of these beloved characters interact together for the first time, and then appropriately be chased by dinosaurs.</div>

Jeff Goldblum of course was phenomenal and fell right back into the role of Ian Malcolm. We gotta all be honest here though... the first two movies of JP were amazing because they were done by Spielberg and based on the books. Everything after just feels like a cheap rip off.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br/><br/>The scenario is Ok. At least it isn't tragic. The first part of the movie is just a mess. The effects are decent as they always were in the whole trilogy. As the last film of the franchise and the jurassic era it had to be epic. And yes. I could say that Jurassic world fallen kingdom was more epic. I belive that it is very big. Being 30 minutes shorter would help very much. I liked some new ideas like a nice fight between people but it was more like uncharted and NOT jurassic world. If steven spielberg directed this movie it would be much better. It wasn't tragic and if I wasn't fan of thIs franchise I would rate it with 6. But I saw many new dinosaurs and luckily I didn't see another hybrid dinosaur which wasn't a dino but a killing machine. Many people say that the story wasn't good and I agree. The scenario was good but it wasn't about dinosaurs. Seriously? Giant grasshoppers put our world in danger???. I was waiting something like dinosaurs put our world in danger. It was generaly a good movie although I was bored in the first 20 minutes but it was not so Jurassic. You could name it Our World dominion. Although it had dinosaures it wasn't the main problem. It was looked like uncharted as I said before but instead of a treasure it had Grasshoppers and a genetically modified girl. WTF?!?!? I would say I honestly enjoyed watching but it isn't a tutorial on how to make a decent film.<br/><br/>Negative facts<br/><br/><ul><li>The first 30 minutes is a mess</li><li>The main problem isn't about dinosaures</li><li>Not an epic end to this franchise</li><li>As someone said here when a dinosaur comes they always try to escape by running or fighting and they always barely make it</li></ul><br/><br/>Possitive facts<br/><br/><ul><li>Decent acting</li><li>Nice audio-visual effects and decent CGI</li><li>Many new species and a quite different story</li><li>There is NOT A HYBRID (I was sooo delighted)</li><li>The end was well directed</li></ul><br/><br/>And as this franchise comes to an end I write below the 6 movies of this franchise in order accordingly which I liked more.<br/><br/>1. Jurassic Park
2. Jurassic World
3. The lost world Jurassic Park
4. Jurassic World Dominion
5. Jurassic World fallen kingdom
6. Jurassic Sucks III.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be. There is too much action, and a lot of it is ridiculous. There are too many characters, and not all the performances are great. The story is somehow both simple and complex.<br/><br/>But this might is genuinely fun. There are some cool dinosaurs, new and old. While some callbacks are a bit heavy-handed, most are pretty light and enjoyable. Big improvement from Fallen Kingdom.<br/><br/>Here's the definitive ranking of the movies for reference:
Jurassic Park
Jurassic World
Dominion
JP3
Lost World
Fallen Kingdom.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I have been primed for this movie a long time. Only to see... this. I don't even know what 'this' is. Please just take it away.<br/><br/>I seriously cannot name a single aspect of the film that I actually did like. So I suppose zero stars would have been more appropriate, but unfortunately I don't have that choice.<br/><br/>I feel for the cast because this could have been epic, instead of just another epic fail. I mean, what happened?!<br/><br/>It was an action movie with no soul, no story. That pretty much sums it up.<br/><br/>I could say more but do I really want to? I guess not. I guess time could be better spent.<br/><br/>Don't watch this film if you want to get use out of your time and money. That's the message here.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Like it was millions of years ago, the time of the dinosaurs is coming to a close. With JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION, we end the Jurassic World trilogy (after having the Jurassic Park trilogy) and it is high time we do so.<br/><br/>A retro-film (as I've been calling these nostalgia-flicks that bring back old actors/characters from previously beloved properties), JURARSSIC WORLD DOMINION is entertaining enough - but the creative brains behind this franchise is just running out of clever ways to put the same group of characters in danger of being eaten by a dinosaur.<br/><br/>Written by Emily Carmichael based on a story by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow and Directed by Trevorrow (returning to helm this franchise after Directing the first Jurassic World flick, but not the 2nd), JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION follows our favorite bickering couple, Clare (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen (Chris Pratt) and their pseudo-pet Velociraptor, Blue as they, once again, go into the Jurassic World fighting a money-grubbing Corporate Billionaire who wants the genetic technology for his own, greedy purposes and not what might be for the good of all - the Earth, the Humans and the Dinosaurs. Along the way good ol' Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (the always quirky Jeff Goldblum) are, somehow, shoe-horned into this story.<br/><br/>And that, ultimately, is the issue with Dominion, the script feels like an amalgam of characters that needed to be serviced and set-pieces that needed to be shown, but the overall story-line and character development (not that there is much here) is shoved to the side, so at the end the emotional connection to this film - and it's characters - is negligible.<br/><br/>What little character interest there is here is based solely on the charisma of the actors and they are...good enough. Pratt, of course, is able to carry the center of this flick as Owen Grady - but he doesn't seem to be occupying the center square with the twinkle in his eye that he had in the first Jurassic World film. Bryce Dallas Howard is plucky enough as Clare, but this actress has been gaining traction lately as a ""go-to"" Director (like her father, Ron Howard) and that is probably a better career trajectory for her. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are ""game enough"" in what they are asked to do, but they both look just a bit tired of running around in front of green screen dinosaurs. Only Jeff Goldblum shines as Ian Malcolm and that's because Trevorrow, wisely, decides to let Goldblum be Goldblum - odd and quirky.<br/><br/>Of the other actors in this film, DeWanda Wise (FATHERHOOD) really shines as a pilot who helps out the gang. On the other hand, Dichen Lachman (SEVERENCE) is completely wasted as a ""top-notch"" henchman that is pretty inept. However, it was good to see Omar Sy (who was in the first JURASSIC WORLD movie and then became a star thanks to his work on the French TV show LUPINE - which is terrific, by the way) back in the fold as it was good to see Campbell Scott back up on the big screen as the villain of the piece - a role that he brings an interesting twist to but, ultimately, the role leads to nowhere.<br/><br/>And that's the issue with this film, the characterizations lead to nowhere, for Trevorrow focuses most of his attention on the battle scenes and the scares - and while not all of them are exciting and unusual, I did find myself jumping in my seat on more than one occasion and there is one scene with Bryce Dallas Howard escaping a dino in a swamp that was pretty intense.<br/><br/>Go see JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION if you've seen the other 5 - you've already invested this much time, you might as well complete the series. But, this film really brings nothing new and is, ultimately, less than what one hopes for in this type of film.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B-<br/><br/>6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Acting, Directing &amp; Casting - Acting felt awkward and uninspired and the long cuts before changing camera angles didn't help. Legacy actors seems more like superstars doing cameos (forever) and unable to convincingly resurrect their original character's essence, humility and synergy. The collaboration of the various legacy actors of the old and new did not seem to gel well. Main 'villain' too styled to Tim Cook of Apple look, poorly casted, background poorly established and more of a villain idiot than villain evil genius to be reckoned with. New lead lady characters too chic like a James Bond fashionistas that can do it all. The lack of focused established leads and generic usage of many legacy characters made me feel lost in direction.<br/><br/>Cinematography &amp; Editing - Bland framing and long cuts make it like a made for TV production with lazy camera movements and composition. 2:1 aspect ratio okay to capture size of dinosaurs, but framing too zoomed in on actors giving a lack of feel of their environment and mostly see the actors. Also, actors look like giants, should have zoomed out a little to consider for big screen, not a TV. That height zoom more useful in anamorphic aspect ratio where the environment is covered on the left and right spaces.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs &amp; CGI - Mostly good CGI and details, but some looked too cartoony and behaved too human like ala Disney and such. While some had good predatory animation and somewhat natural animal movements and mannerism, some had awkward and stiff control of their bodies as if a human had possessed the dinosaurs and figuring out how to use its limbs. The interactions of the alpha dinosaurs were awkwardly lost and poorly choreographed. The film trailers with outdoor cinemas and ""documentary"" wildlife feature are purely promotional (i.e. Misleading)<br/><br/>Story - The redux on Blue and Maisie as a material part of ""purpose"" and their revelations and throwbacks are uninspiring. The ""evil corp"" doing woke detriment to the world is also so bland. Nothing intelligent. The ""oooo"" something behind the scenes is going on that is slowly unraveled to the audience is so poorly filmed and revealed that it was almost like little children playing make believe. Everything seems poorly established and shot (again with lazy cinematography, cuts/editing, dull framing and timing like a daytime drama). There was an essence of espionage and its relevant rush action, but I felt it out of place and too ""copy and paste"".<br/><br/>Conclusion - This film lacks direction, ideation and inspiration, full of stale recycled formulae poorly executed. To the die hard fans, just watch it to scratch that dodgy itch, see some eye candy and be able to say you did it, but expect to be disappointed to a point of disgust. Did you watch Terminator Dark Fate? Its the same WTH vibe.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I love the original movie, and I thought The Lost World was a great sequel. While Jurassic Park 3 certainly has its flaws, it still felt like a ""Jurassic Park"" movie to me. I grew up watching these movies.<br/><br/>Let's go back to the year 2015, after 14 years of rumors of another JP movie with the most bizarre concepts (Google them, they're out there) being tossed around, they finally landed on Jurassic World. I couldn't believe they finally figured out a script and production had actually happened. The movie was done. Finally!<br/><br/>Well, after waiting all those years I went to see Jurassic World opening night, I couldn't have been more excited to finally see it. Was it good? Eh. There some moments that were good, but the overuse of CGI watered it down. Training raptors to follow commands? What happened to the blood thirsty raptors from the first 2 movies? Now they take orders from humans?<br/><br/>Then we have Fallen Kinngdom. I really enjoyed the tension of the opening scene. The flash of lightning that shows Rexy sneak up behind the guy trying to close the gates was chilling. I thought I was in for a treat. Goldblum is wasted in a 4 minute scene... It turned into some convoluted hybrid mess with a terrible subplot to set up for Dominion.<br/><br/>Now, we finally get this supposed ""epic conclusion"" to the franchise that brings back Grant, Sattler and Malcom combined with our new ""heroes"" and it all sounds good on paper. What we have instead is a giant mess of way too many CGI dinosaur action sequences. I thought Owen riding along side the raptors in the first World movie was bad.... Jeez. There are no great or epic moments, hardly any tension., it's just a bunch of computer animated dinosaurs thrown together on screen just for the sake of it. Unfortunately these movies get worse with each entry, and this is no exception. While we do get a couple nods and homages to the original movie, it just felt forced. Nothing about this movie felt genuine. Even the actors from the original trilogy felt like they were just bored.... And how many times are we going to have raptors encounter people just to have them stop immediately cause they someone put their hand up in front of them.<br/><br/>I don't know, go see the movie for yourself, but don't expect any of the magic or charisma that first trilogy brought to the table. What we have is another watered down, CGI fest with no real emotion or thought put behind it. It just felt really stale. Fell flat on its face.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It boggles my mind that both this and Fallen Kingdom are both rated higher than JP3. JP3 is bad, but it's at least mercifully short and had a cool apex predator threat.<br/><br/>Dominion is long, boring and doesn't have a single moment of suspense, tension or genuine fear. There are exactly two positive things about JW3: Kayla (DeWanda Wise) and the 5 second clip of the little girl getting terrorized by the compys.<br/><br/>Everything else is loud garbage. They do nothing to explore any kind of serious effect dinosaurs would have on our ecosystem. Dinosaurs invading the mainland, the ENTIRE premise of this stupid movie, get about 10 minutes of screen time. Everything else takes place in a jungle, science lab or isolated, wooded location. It may as well have just taken place on Nublar or Sorna.<br/><br/>Skip this. I thought there was no way JW3 could be as bad as JW2 and I was dead wrong. They're both about the sale level of dumb, but JW3 is so much more boring than JW2, which I also hate.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I love the first Jurassic Park (1993), and I thought Jurassic Park: The Lost World (1997) and Jurassic Park 3 (2001) both were just ok.<br/><br/>I thought Jurassic World (2015) was dumb fun and I thought Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) was the worst one in the Jurassic Park/World movie series.<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) was the of the Jurassic Park/World movie series, and it is....<br/><br/>I thought Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) was better than Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018). Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) has plot issues, it does not have a clear connection with the last movie, but it has fun and entertaining scenes.<br/><br/>I will not give any spoilers. The main plot is not what we thought it could have been and what we from this movie with the dinosaurs are in some action scenes, but not in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both good in the movie and cool seeing them in action or suspenseful scenes. The original cast from Jurassic Park (1993) return and its great seeing them Interact with the Jurassic World cast.<br/><br/>I loved the return of Sam Neill as Alan Grant, Laura Seen as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. They were all good and I liked seeing them and the Jurassic World cast work together in the 3rd act against the main villain dinosaur.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fun to watch and there are suspenseful scenes involving some dinosaurs. The dinosaurs look good and have nice effects, I also saw some interesting looking dinosaurs with unique designs that look cool.<br/><br/>The big problem of the movie is the main plot and how it changes a certain story that was in the past film. I thought the beginning of the movie was slow, but it starts to pick up once it starts to go through the 2nd act and the 3rd act.<br/><br/>The movie has references to the first Jurassic Park (1993), and the 3rd act was fun to watch. The 3rd act was suspenseful and cool seeing all the main characters from Jurassic Park and Jurassic World interacting and working together to stop the main dinosaur threat.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was confusing, and I did not know how we were led to it. Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) has an ok ending the movie series and was better than the last movie, but I think this could have been better if they gave us more of what we wanted and did not have a side plot in the way.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">In my opinion the original and fallen kingdom are the best of the JP/JW movies. I had high expectations for this one. But what you get is almost no dino's, no world destroyed with dinosaurs ruling the earth. To compare this with the lost world, one T rex makes complete chaos in a city. Just a weak story telling of bugs and people. It has nothing to do about dino's. They are just in it. If you see the ending of fallen kingdom, you think that the next movie wil be complete chaos with all the dino's in the loose. But no, not even a single time rexy is in. Jeff Goldblum is the best part of this movie, with some easter eggs from the original. And blue has a small part in the movie. Besides that, this is the worst in the franchise. And a shame this movie franchise has to end like this.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World: Dominion picks up four years later. But instead of an epic clash for territory, this trilogy-closer chooses to retread the greatest hits and use its prehistoric animals mostly as props and turning them into a sub-plot. A really convoluted plot that didn't make sense. Choppy direction and horrible use of the legacy characters. The CGI seemed to be downgraded in this film somehow when compared to the previous instalment. Though some set pieces and animatronics were mesmerising to see. Overall a dumb boring movie that had the potential to be great. The producers were too pre occupied on wether or not they could make a movie and not wether or not they should.<br/><br/>Acting: 5/10 (nothing stood out in this film. Besides Chris Pratt's Charisma and the on screen presence of the legacy actors, it was basic acting who could have been replaced by anyone.<br/><br/>Action: 6/10 (All you want from a jurassic movie is Dinosaurs running amoc and killing people. When there was dino action it was great but so little of it and quickly finished left you wishing there was more. The whole malta sequence was perfectly executed. Though it had great animatronics, some CGI scenes of the Dinos was so bad it took you away from what was happening on screen and asking yourself what on earth happened here? Clearly they forgot the famous quote of the first film ""spare no expense"")<br/><br/>Sound: 8/10 (I had the luxury to see this in a Dolby Atmos theatre. Sound design was amazing. Not as good as Topgun Maverick or Michael Bay's Ambulance but good enough to make you appreciate the surround sound. The Dilophosaurus scene is where it really accentuates the Dolby Atmos technology.<br/><br/>Story: 1/10 (Convoluted plot and over all boring. Dinosaurs became a sub-plot to the story arc. Poor character development. Most notably the poor use of the legacy characters. Biggest disappointment was the character of Dr Allan Grant. Sam Niel did amazing for what he was given but writing and arc of his character in this film was abysmal.<br/><br/>Feels/Nostalgia: 5/10 (There could have been great Nostalgia but poorly executed and barely used in my opinion. There were some cute emotional scenes between Humans and Dinos but the boring plot over shadowed those moments.<br/><br/>Over all score 5/10.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Giving legacy characters the time to shine alongside their modern counterparts, the film steps on the gas right out of the gate and becomes one dinosaur nightmare after another. Weaving each legacy character tightly into the new story line like they were meant to be there all along. This movie takes you to fun and exciting places. You really feel like Trevarrow set out to make an epic conclusion to a franchise that's had its ups and downs.<br/><br/>Relying on a lot of in camera effects, more so than other Jurassic World installments, made the film feel like classic Hollywood from the 90's. You may remember the time where entertainment was just that. The cinematography was big and bold. The dialogue made you laugh and feel good. Effects left you in wonderment. All without pushing a narrative that takes away from being entertained. Dominion's mixture of puppetry and CGI made the world feel tangible. It's a thrill ride that's full of the same dinosaur magic that made the original film feel so alive. The heartfelt moments are earned. Malcolm's witty personality is on full display. The legacy characters have closure. This film is tense, it's smart, and it's fun for the whole family!<br/><br/>Don't listen to the critics! This film is exactly what the original film set out to do in 1993... entertain you! It's classic Hollywood at its finest, and I loved it! This is the Jurassic movie you didn't know you wanted, but now can't live without.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">SAVE UR MONEY. This has to be the worst movie in the entire series. JP3 is Godfather compared to this. Fallen Kingdom is Oscar worthy compared to this. They made us wait 2 extra years for this. No story whatsoever, no conflict, no conclusion. This doesn't even end the story, NOTHING happened!!!! So no sorry but lots of Dinosaurs right? HECK NO, not even that much action, barely any TREX till the last few minutes and he doesn't do anything. Hope this is truly the end. Either Spielberg needs to return or stop letting others direct to get a easy paycheck. Hope this movie bombs!!! So disappointed.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't believe how bad this was. Can directors just focus on making a good movie and stop trying to deliver messages to everyone within the movie? The movie was all over the place as old Jurassic Park, new Jurassic Park, let's be some Indiana Jones, let's tell people playing with genetics is bad, let's tell everyone not to breed wild animals cause that's bad, let's talk about how we're destroying the environment cause that's bad and finally, let's let everyone know that we need to all co-exist, including man and other animals co-existing with dinosaurs apparently??? Good Lord! Oh and check this out...Dotson from the original is the bad guy now and if you didn't catch that during the film, we have Jeff Goldblum look at him and say his name once as he's being fired.... Dotson.....and if you still didn't get it, we had Dotson grab the can of shaving cream he gave to Newman in the original movie ....You get it now?....that was Dotson...He's the new bad guy!!!! Isn't that so cool that we did that!! - Oh my lord sooooo terrible!</div>

Movies claimed to be in 3D, but you can watch this 3D movie without glasses, just tell you how great 3D it has! Controlling dinosaurs with chip, giant locust invasion, human clone point us to shoddy patch work so as to keep on story going for 2:30 hrs. Will be successful on just hype of the franchisee!</div>

I adore the original 3 Jurassic parks, and even Jurassic world....but the last two instalments are utter trash....didn't think they could make this one worse than fallen kingdom....but they really outdid themselves and made it drastically worse. Everything that's wrong with modern day blockbusters....all in one movie.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Without a doubt the worst yet, something to surpass Jurassic Park 3 and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, this is the final nail. Such a terrible movie: convenience at every turn, shoehorned in political correctness, and nostalgia treatment of the lowest quality that tries, failingly, to bridge the plot and make sense of what is happening. From boring character to boring character, there was lots of nothing going on. A sad finale, though one that has been long coming.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Wow I waited months and months for this movie to come to theatres, I absolutely loved the first two Jurassic World movies. Where do I even start, this movie is confusing as heck. One minute you're in Texas, then Utah, then Nevada, then Italy, there's no real story to tie everything together, waaaaaaay too much dialogue and too many new characters. After an hour and 20 minutes I was wondering when the action was going to start and when it did, it wasn't all that great. This one in my opinion, was a flop.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I almost wanted to go back and watch the first movie to remind myself what made this franchise so special, after enduring 2.5 hours of this. Around the third/fourth act admittedly there are one or two nice dino-fights, but overall:<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Constant mentions of climate change and 'working together'
&gt;&gt; Great diverse cast, but they forgot to write a good plot in the meantime
&gt;&gt; 'In house Philosopher'?!?! Jeff Goldblum's ridiculous job title
&gt;&gt; Saccharin visual and musical 'call backs' to the first movie throughout
&gt;&gt; Apple Boss lookalike as BioSyn's CEO - oooo bad corrupt old men, that's a new conceit<br/><br/>I would like escapism when I take the trouble to go to the cinema (a not too often event these days), not to be lectured to or have 'subtle' political messages woven into the story.<br/><br/>Come on movie makers, remember escapism?</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Top Gun sequel took 4 or 5 steps up compared to the first, while Dominion took 4 or 5 steps down. There were a lot of action scenes that were OK to watch, and some were actual fun to. The problem is the story did not, at all, have the suspense of the first one. It never drew you into the plot, it just became too preachy. Sad, since it could have been good, but it wasn't.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Not a very epic conclusion if you ask me. It's a really boring and uninteresting plot that jumps around a lot with a couple excellent action scenes, and a few terrible ones. The first 30 minutes is used to just catch up on all the characters and it doesn't really have any special moments to make it interesting, even the legacy characters coming back didn't feel as awesome as it should've. For the second act it's mostly 2 different plot points happening at once, the legacy characters trying to expose the CEO bad guy, and the new characters trying to rescue Maisie and Blue's child. Neither are super interesting but the new characters end up in a Malta action sequence that is absolutely amazing. In the meantime the legacy characters are just trying to extract some DNA and it's not really that interesting and not much really happens. A couple really good action scenes with the new characters and then they all converge for the final act, which is the biggest disappointment of it all. There's a few fun interactions between all of the characters, but the action itself is slow and meanders without being really tense. In the end the characters just kinda get on a helicopter and 2 dinosaurs randomly come in and fight, it's basically the end of the first Jurassic world and the second Jurassic world combined to make a really boring ending. Overall the movie underutilized its legacy characters and meanders too much with only a few excellent action scenes and a very unepic conclusion.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic Park has been my favourite film since it had first come out. It is a perfect masterpiece, that overcomes any flaw by grabbing you emotionally, as well as still being one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The sequels, while not being nearly as good, all delivered on the dinosaur action and had some good moments (the action in Lost World and 3 at times rivaled the action in that original movie, and World had some excellent ideas and moments of awe). But each one carried with it a little less of the magic than the last one. Here at Jurassic World Dominion that magic is gone. Its been flushed down the toilet!<br/><br/>The film has 2 stories. Owen and Claire are rescuing a kidnapped girl and baby raptor. And then Alan Grant, Ellie Setler and Ian Malcolm are doing some espionage to stop an evil corporation from doing some dodgy stuff. Oh, also there are dinosaurs...sometimes, when the script needs them.<br/><br/>There is no sugar coating it. This was terrible. Absolutely terrible! Fallen Kingdom, while not being a film I like, had a weird charm to it; great visuals, good direction and a Corman-esk final act. This, I appreciate now, elevated it from being garbage, even if it had none of what made the original good in the first place. So, and you read right, Dominion lacks what made Fallen Kingdom 'good'.<br/><br/>Other than the nostalgia of seeing Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldbloom together again, this film has nothing going for it. It is completely soulless. The story doesn't work, and often uses action scenes to make it look like we are going somewhere. Most of the new actors are giving horrible performances. The music sucks, unless they use the original score in poorly placed moments. It is cripplingly boring on top of it all.<br/><br/>The rest of the series coasted on dino action when all else failed. This was why I went to see this one. But even that is a let down. There are many types of dinosaurs here, but the dinosaurs feel secondary to everything else that is going on. The action rings hollow. Not to spoil, but the ending action scene left so little impact, it was shocking. You can't even enjoy the effects this time as they are easily the worst of the whole series. The CGI is fine, if a little wonky at times, but the animatronics are worse than those on the theme park ride. Stan Winston will be rolling in his grave.<br/><br/>There are moments here and there. A scene involving a dinosaur with enormous claws was genuinely well done. Sam Neill and the others are great to watch. A tunnel scene with the dilophosaurus was creepy. And there are a good number of moments that had me laughing at the stupidity and absurdity of it all.<br/><br/>In the end, that first film being my favourite of all time and the rest being good (or at least dumb) fun, I really didn't like this one. I am unsure as to whether I hate it or not, but that I am contemplating this, it is just sad to me. I felt like I was watching my copy of Jurassic Park burn. I don't care if they make any more, this is the last one for me.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is bad, so bad I'm writing this review instead of watching the rest of it. It has bad acting, bad story, bad continuity, bad characters and even bad cgi/models. I love the Jurassic franchise but this is bad! Very bad! Very very bad! I will say it entertaining in some sort of way... it made me think of different way I could blind myself so I didn't have to watch it anymore. I have decided the best way would be to use mine and my wife's straws and just stab them hard and fast straight into them!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If your a true fan you would have enjoyed this, if not then move along. Action packed all the way through, I know it's not real but it did get me on the edge of my seat a few times. Loads of shout outs to the original films. Loved all the cast together. For the reviews saying there was no storyline I suggest you watch it again. It was a roarsome cornfest. We can't take these films to seriously if you did then shame on you go watch David Attenborough instead. Loved rexys special appearance can't have a Jurrasic Park/world without rexy. If you don't like it go buy yourself a personality or just simply don't watch it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Acting was done great. Got the legends back who kind of carried this garbage plot movie too. And great visual effects! (Definitely you would get that from the insane dollars they spend on cgi)<br/><br/>But the plot, ATROCIOUS! The setup of humans and dinosaurs coming together, will they manage to coexist and what challenges they will face. This went OFF THE RAILS!<br/><br/>Story was completely some different unnecessary thing showing some stupid emotions about things I could hardly care about.<br/><br/>Make a 3D dinosaur documentary. I would gladly watch that than this s**t!</div>

Giant, engineered locusts are the real big bad of this film.<br/><br/>We can co-exist peacefully with dinosaurs, folks. There's enough trees, vegetation, space and they're woke enough where they won't completely eradicate another species. No, they'll run along side horses and swim with whales....oh and they totally won't venture away from their habitat in the mountains because why would they? It's a freaking paradise.<br/><br/>I honestly was waiting for Blue to actually open her raptor mouth full of razor sharp teeth and say ""thank you"" by the end of the film.

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Much better than Fallen Kingdom, had fun and I will rewatch this one. There are some really cool scenes with the dinosaurs (oh I love the aquatic scene with Claire), the visual effects are fantastic and some nostalgia also works.<br/><br/>Now...it is underwhelming. With the trio coming back and being the film that ends the trilogy, I expected much more. First, the first act of the film is a disaster. The pace is terrible, unfocused and doesn't feel Jurassic Park/World at all. Second, the plot...ffs! What was that? Definitely not what I was looking for on a Dinossaur movie. Such weird editing decisions, at least 20 minutes to cut...<br/><br/>At least, it gets much better since Malta, especially after the plane crash (well, including). In short, not as terrible as critics say. It's fun, it's entertaining, but it could and should be much more than what it is.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Alright, so the Dinos are awesome especially the original feathered ones. Neil and Laura have amazing chemistry and Jeff is as always Jeff. Some of the scenes feel like straight out of a horror movie and its incredible. And that's it. The rest is ridiculous: Distances, Physics, Geography, Biology, Weather all these are mere nuisances that get ignored. Plot Convenciences on every corner, cheesy dialogue and so many characters it felt like watching a clown posse trying to escape in a clown car. It got to a point i got so annoyed. Why is everyone pretending Dinos are bulletproof? Why does everyone conveniently find each other again and again in a place the size of a small country? Same scenes of Dinos looking like idiots and not attacking until they need to... people coming out of a fullstop airplane crashes looking better than before, more cringe dialogue, raptors with feathers diving like torpedos at minus degrees through a frozen lake, so many dino hand taming gestures it felt like i am watching FaceOff ! Seems like that hand gesture is how to tame a dino spin off movie. God Damn! Burning Locusts that seem to resemble Napalm and light a fire on the whole are in less than 2 minutes, this movie is less realistic than lord of the rings. See you next time Jurassic Planet in Space.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">A blazing spectacle of exquisite and rich cinema. I guarantee this film will go down in history as a misunderstood classic. It's a movie too big for the masses. Only few will be able to grasp the behemoth in front of them with fire in their eyes. This is a movie movie. It's why we go to the cinema in this modern era. The legacy cast, sharp and aged like wine you'd only open for important celebrations, reigns superbly in a grand appearance. The Dinos, bigger, different, demanding awe. And the new cast, bringing fresh power to this thrilling grandiose achievement. It's jaw dropping material. It's different. It's packed with just about everything. It's Jurassic World: Dominion.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The summer box office continues to heat up with this weeks' release of Jurassic World Dominion, the sixth and final installment of the popular movie franchise based on Michael Crichton's novels. Twenty-nine years after Jurassic Park, dinosaurs are living and hunting alongside humans taxing the fragile balance of nature all over the world. Well, that's what we're led to believe is the setup for Jurassic World Dominion, however, the movie we actually get is an altogether different beast.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion is essentially two different films with the original trio of Sam Neil (Alan Grant), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Jeff Goldblum (Ian Malcolm) reuniting in one story (the more interesting of the two in my opinion) and Chris Pratt (Owen Grady) and Bryce Dallas Howard (Claire Dearing) picking up and continuing their story from Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. Eventually the two stories meet and everything is brought to a conclusion.<br/><br/>Sadly, the conclusion, as well as the ride leading up to it is far from spectacular or overall satisfying.<br/><br/>The pacing in Jurassic World Dominion is clunky and uneven, particularly in the beginning. Many of the themes are heavy handed and preachy to the point of making you feel you're sitting in a lecture hall. Oddly enough, Ian's actual lecture in the film is more entertaining and thought provoking than the bludgeoning messaging throughout the rest of the film. The call backs to previous films in many cases are stale. With the exception of the original Big Three, the returning characters are lifeless (in Pratt's case the film plays more like a contractual obligation) and uninspired. BD Wong's Dr. Wu takes an unexpected turn and the resolution of his story line feels unearned. New characters aren't fleshed out and act more as props to get from point a to point b than characters.<br/><br/>Worse still, Jurassic World Dominion, is a dinosaur movie that has little to do with dinosaurs. Again, Goldblum's Ian says it best when he goes off on the seduction of dinos excusing what's going on. A note that the writers should of taken when sussing out the story. Dinosaurs are freely living among humans, what's that like? Dunno, it's glossed over save for a few references. I mean at one point in this 2 hour 26 minute film you go a good half hour to forty minutes without seeing or hearing ANYTHING about the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Serious bait and switch as well as a major disappointment.<br/><br/>The biggest saving grace of Dominion is the legacy characters, especially Goldblum's Ian. The wit, charm, and humor is classic. All three actors seem to be having a blast and it shows and you feel it ever time they're on screen. When you get the dinosaurs they look amazing. These bad boys never fail to delight.<br/><br/>All told Jurassic World Dominion looks great, has some shining moments, but ultimately is lifeless. If this is what the franchise has to offer, it's time to let it go the way of actual dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion gets a disappointing 5 from me.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Lots of dinosaurs, action and explosions. It felt like quite a long couple of hours. I thought is was an OK movie and contained all the Jurassic sequel elements you'd expect, but that was about it. I feel pretty bad leaving this as a review considering there was obviously 'no expense spared' in the making of this film and the cast that was put together to bring it to the big screen. But in short it was just OK, not one I'll be looking out for when it if released onto streaming channels.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie wasn't even about dinosaurs.... But about locusts?!? I went with my friend last night she goes OMG that was the BEST Jurassic movie ever!!!! And I'm sitting there going wtf are you talking about...what movie did you see... it was terrible! We have been looking forward to this day for 2 years and was incredibly excited to see the old cast and this is what we get?!?! Every movie that came out was about dinosaurs with a plot about dinosaurs... this had nothing to do with dinosaurs...<br/><br/>Movie 1: group goes to dinosaur island #1
Movie 2: second group goes to dinosaur island #2
Movie 3: third group of people go to dinosaur island #2 Movie 4: Island #1 creates new dinosaur theme park
Movie 5: Save dinosaurs from island and take them to a new sanctuary
Movie 6: Locusts are destroying food production as in grain, corn, etc and oldie but goodies try to stop the company responsible, and newbies are protecting a girl because bad guys want girls dna to change the locusts behavior.... You'll see dinosaurs along the way?!?<br/><br/>I mean yes the characters would come across new dinosaurs along the way and either run hide or kill them but that's completely different...it's just like King Kong... you see dinosaurs along the way that doesn't mean the movie is about dinosaurs. I don't want to get into it too much but I'm asking everyone: if you didn't like the movie please review it! To Hollywood: STOP making dinosaur movies!!! You're butchering the franchise!!!<br/><br/>Very disappointed, I will not see again, I do not recommend!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I walked into my local Odeon today, for an evening of cinematic entertainment, and walked out of it with a headache.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is setup. Yes, the entire first hour just sets up the story. We felt like we were stuck in the writers' room, and had various versions of the script thrown at us. The VFX were quite impressive. The sound design, not as much. There was so much screaming, screeching, metal bending, vehicles crashing, airplanes getting blown out of the sky, and all that noise kept going for so long. Two hours of this type of noise, almost non-stop, and with almost no music to give our ears a break. Pretty sure that's where the headache came from.<br/><br/>The plot is quite thin, but I didn't really mind that since, come on, it's Jurassic World. I did mind that the jump scares were noisy instead of scary. I did mind that the film didn't make me fear for the characters' lives, not only because the dangers they were in were always so out of proportions they should have died 10000 times, but also because it didn't let me care about the characters. Sam Neal could have been gobbled up on the, I think, 45 minute mark, when he showed up, and I would have probably been fine with that.<br/><br/>Also, look out for the scene where Baddie#1235 is lying down, both hands being eaten up by 2 separate dinosaurs, and still has the mental capacity to give our protagonist the information he needs, instead of screaming his head off in terror and pain.<br/><br/>We gave up at the point where they managed to get all the characters together, more than 2 hours in, and after a long, long, escape scene, they got to yet more exposition on how they'd escape. In that moment, me and my friend looked at each other, realised there was probably an extra 40 minutes of film, grabbed our stuff and left.<br/><br/>This film is empty calories. There are no jokes, no cute quotes, no sense of wonder, not even the thrill/slight terror of watching humans getting hunted by dinosaurs. Save your money, watch it at home. Save your braincells, bypass it entirely.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I've seen Jurassic Park in 1993 and that's what started the whole franchise. Then I've seen The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Then Jurassic Park 3. In 2015, I've seen Jurassic World. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in 2018. Now Jurassic World: Dominion.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard still have great chemistry together. Their characters were definitely the parental type for Maisie. It was great to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum reuniting for this final installment of the entire franchise. The action is great as what the fans have seen throughout the years. I've noticed that some people are tired of seeing the same plot in every film that they've watched. It's always the screaming and running. It's just like watching Lex and Tim run and scream all over again. In the previous films that I've seen, there are bad guys and villains. I get it that people are tired of it and I know that I'm sort of getting tired of the same plot but it's great this film is the final installment of the entire franchise, so I don't think they won't make another film. Saying that I'm tired of watching the same plot in the previous films doesn't make me hate the entire franchise. No, I've enjoyed all five films including this sixth and final installment.<br/><br/>I've noticed that the film had tone it down a bit because the violent carnage or anything that we've seen. The film has funny lines especially with Jeff Goldblum's character, Ian Malcolm. The action and CGI are definitely to watch for. In conclusion, this film is great to watch for the action and thrills.</div>

It failed to do the basic thing for these type of movies which is to be entertaining (Unless some action moments)!!! The story here is the worst in the franchise and the movie is too long.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The screen was cropped due to the aspect ratio. (I saw it in PVR India &amp; not IMAX).<br/><br/>Well, it starts from where they left in 2018. The dinosaurs are living among the public, throughout the world. Making a place for themselves in the eco system.<br/><br/>They have a huge star cast, especially from the Jurassic park franchise.<br/><br/>It's one time watch, with a predictable storyline and awful dialogues.<br/><br/>You must go with your lil ones(kids) or there is no adventure in it.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) is a movie we watched as a family in theatres last night. The storyline follows a world that is trying to adjust to dinosaurs being a regular part of every day life. Meanwhile an evil organization looks to exploit circumstances by creating genetically engineered locusts to destroy the Earths food so you need to rely on them to survive...oh, and they want to steal Hammond's cloned niece. It will take the heroes from every movie of the Jurassic Park series to save the day.<br/><br/>This movie is directed by Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World) and stars Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), Sam Neill (Event Horizon), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Mamoudou Athie (Uncorked) and Laura Dern (Blue Velvet).<br/><br/>This movie, unfortunately, it's about the same as Jurassic World: Kingdom. The dinosaurs and special effects are awesome. There's some tremendous species of dinosaurs and dinosaur battles, especially the last one. Unfortunately for the storyline, it reminded me of John Wick 3, just an excuse for dinosaur scenes like that John Wick was just an excuse for action scenes with a flimsy cliché storyline. There were also too many subplots going on in here - some were fun and entertaining (black market and underground trade was well done, locusts and cloned child not so much). The acting was fine but the cast could have been way better utilized with better writing.<br/><br/>Overall this was a fun popcorn flick as long as you go in with the right mind set. Think of it like watching Fast and Furious, Transformers and John Wick; no it's not going to be a good movie, but the dinosaurs are cool. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I genuinely think there's a culture now where it's cool to hate things, especially established things and by proxy try and make it seem that everything from this generation is superior, we see constantly awful new tv and movies scoop awards whilst they're a chore to watch, yet great movie franchises get panned, top gun seems to be the exception.<br/><br/>This movie isn't bad at all, I read through reviews, people hating on the strangest of things, saying there was no plot, yet there's a clear plot, multi layered and from different angles. That dinosaurs didn't feauture more, there were plenty that were used right, the fact you wanted more shows you think they were good. So many other nonsensical ""opinions"" copy and pasted by those just jumping on the badwagon of being cool to hate.<br/><br/>The only negative for me was the main villain, not enough of a presence and not the best acting, other than that I didn't see anything wrong with it, no one I spoke to had anything negative to say and conversations I heard after were all positive.<br/><br/>I'll give you one task, find any of these negative reviews that offer any form of coherent improvements or arguments that would've improved the film, I'm not talking about making it shorter, adding more dinosaurs in, I mean the plot and execution. I read many a pompous self gratifying reviewer talking utter rubbish with no justification.<br/><br/>I read 50 negative reviews and found not one offered anything but childish logic either from someone who's either not seen it, or saw it and liked it but saw it's more trendy to hate it so made up a bad review.<br/><br/>The effects are brilliant, plot made sense and everything to me was great, the only mistake for me was not making it over two parts, as dinosaurs in the real world was always what I wanted to see, so splitting it into two films, adding some more set pieces or landmarks with the dinosaurs interacting would've been awesome but think that's just me wanting to see more cool moments and visuals because I enjoyed a great movie.<br/><br/>Ignore the hate, have your OWN opinions for a change, stop being sheep.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went into this film with high expectations and they were barely met which is okay. This didn't feel like a Jurassic film. It felt like a Mission Impossible movie with dinosaurs. There's some call backs to Kenner artwork which felt like a nice touch. Jeff Goldblum in my opinion carried this film. His character felt the most important. You should never go into this film expecting an Oscar winning script. These films have never made sense so when you apply realism to this franchise resort it to the dinosaurs. I loved the animatronics which made it feel like the first film allot. Don't listen to critics and go see this movie. If you love dinosaurs and you turn your brain off you'll have a great time with friends.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The teasers, the trailers, the returning characters... The hype.<br/><br/>This film had it all, except a decent storyline.<br/><br/>Basically a generic story of a billionaire seeking world domination, with a few dinosaurs chucked in for gimmick effect.<br/><br/>Only positive was seeing the legendary Dilophasaurus return. Should have really watched Top Gun Maverick again.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you are trying to waste your money then this is the movie for you, nothing about this movie feels like Jurassic Park in any measurable sense. Not even the old cast could save this dumpster fire; the writing is terrible, the characters are bland, most of it is nonstop action sequences which go on forever and the dialogue seems as if it was written by a zoomer with the attention span and memory of a golfball.<br/><br/>This is a terrible rehash of what we've seen before, there's nothing of interest in this movie unless you are catered towards stupid mindless films. There's literally a scene where a dinosaur breathes fire, that should tell you how bad this movie really is. I walked out halfway through the movie, don't waste your money on this.</div>

The movie is not so bad as suggested by user reviews and critics

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am honestly disappointed with this film. I had gone to see this movie full of expectations and found only disappointment.<br/><br/>It lacks an interesting plot, the characters seem to find themselves almost by chance in the various places. It lacks depth of characters, they lack depth or anything else.... Even the historical characters from the previous films appear depressed!<br/><br/>Same with the dialogues and scenes.... It seems as if this film was made unwillingly. It is nothing compared to the old trilogy or the first Jurassic world! Even the confrontations with the dinosaurs come across as lacking substance, boring and put there just to insert something.....<br/><br/>Really, save yourself this disappointment.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't usually write reviews but this movie was so bad I felt I needed too. I was extremely excited for this movie and I should have just walked out. I kept holding on that it might get better, it never did. This is on the worst movies I have seen in recent memory. This movie had absolutely nothing to do with dinosaurs, they were just kind of there while this script chased two different story lines trying desperately to merge them together at the end. Neither of which had anything to do with dinosaurs or co-existing together. That came at the last 5mins. Terrible way to end an otherwise outstanding franchise. Don't waste your money.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Bigger and scarier dinosaurs, heart-pounding sound effects, and plot twists mixed with plenty of adventures are just what you can expect from Jurassic World Dominion! From the beginning to the end of the movie, there are tons of action-packed scenes to keep you literally jumping for more. Fans of the Jurassic Park franchise will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion centers around two different storylines. On one hand, Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), a teenager, who happens to be a clone of her biological mother, is kidnapped and taken to a company called Biosyn to become a science experiment so scientists can learn how her biological mother created her. On the other hand, her parents, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), set out on an adventure to rescue her. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is suspicious of the works of Biosyn and its animal experiments, as well as its attempt to take over the food chain. She brings in Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to help her stop Biosyn from taking over. The two storylines eventually combine for one suspenseful adventure that happens to take place all while dinosaurs are threatening the characters' existence.<br/><br/>The main characters in this film are Maisie, Claire, Owen, Alan, Ellie, and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). There are references and character appearances from other movies in the Jurassic Park franchise. I enjoyed seeing how characters from different parts of the film join together to save Maisie and end up trying to save each other and become a family while working together. There are some funny scenes throughout the film, and I loved seeing the characters communicating with the dinosaurs and even making them promises. The movie takes you on an emotional rollercoaster as you root for the good guys to not only survive but to win.<br/><br/>This film touches on family and whether or not dinosaurs and humans can co-exist. You'll have to watch the movie to find out. While I highly enjoyed Jurassic World Dominion, this film may not be suitable for people who have certain fears/anxieties or even suffer from PTSD. Parents should look out for scenes with extreme violence, gory deaths, and loads of jump scares.<br/><br/>I give Jurassic World Dominion 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This film roars into theaters on June 10, 2022. By Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">But omg this has to be the worst movie that has come out so far in 2022! Baring the CGI which was pretty good (and the only reason its not 1 star), everything was off. The story was bland, the bad guy was so generic with no motive apart from ""control"" it was laughable, the acting was wooden, the plot holes were massive... i could go on but theres no point. Give it a miss and let the franchise die its already far too slow and painful death. They should have left it at Jurassic World as a 1 off callback then called it a day.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really liked this one. A nice hommage with it's own style. Old school summer blockbuster with an interesting story and great dinosaur effects (both practical and digital). Just sit back and enjoy the ride.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">While fans of the original may enjoy the reunion of the original trio, the film is unsurprisingly mediocre. It never really climbs out of the hole that it's terribly flat villain and clunky dialogue dug for it. And while the dinosaurs are (for the most part) beautiful and the amount of animatronic pieces are impressive, the main villain dinosaur is not shown very much at all, and depressingly harmless and rather useless when it is. Although most of the film struggles to find its voice, the chase through (CENSORED) was thrilling, enjoyable, and truly Jurassic in the amount of action and fun it has. Technically impressive but with a poor script, Dominion has enough fun callbacks to recommend a viewing in theaters.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is better than i was expecting. It had great visual effects, a story that had a sense and a fantastic chemistry between the cast old and new. The script is better than Jurassic world and jurassic world fallen kingdom. The thing that i loved a lot are the variety of places: Malta, unite states and italy. The dinosaurs are beautiful. The cinematography is amazing and great with some shot that are going to be mentioned for years. I know what critica are saying but this is a great ending for the saga that started in 1993 by Steven Spielbierg.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">So preoccupied with whether they could they didn't stop to think of whether or not they should? Dodgson you see nobody cares! However enough people care for the nostalgia of old folks returning that this will probably make enough to do the job and be on its way. Memorable? Well there are some nice moments yet many of these moments are a repeat of a story told. The die hard Jurassic fans will happily go along for the ride like always, but the less enthusiastic who will wanna be seeing something different might be more difficult to sway, more stubborn. Mostly this is there own damn fault, what more can you expect? The formula can't change much, it's always gonna be the wow look a dinosaur before all hell breaks loose. If it isn't broke don't fix it! Although maybe a wise move is to say this is the very end of the Jurassic era. Milk it much further and you'll have an even less tangible authentic product, in fact you'll have Pamela Anderson's breasts, except they'll be deflated of any life. You'll be faking it into obscurity.<br/><br/>The originals weren't so tiresome they didn't fit, no not by a long shot! They brought life like performances whilst remaining true to the origins of their characters. Jeff Goldblum was a stand out once again for me bringing a lighthearted sense of humour and not allowing it to be taken too seriously. Sam Neil and Laura Dern once again gave very natural performances. I'd say the film did seem a little disjointed at first bouncing from the newer characters played by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard to reintroducing the originals.<br/><br/>Colin Trevorrow certainly brings the action to a new level in this cinematic experience with new locations and amazing motorbike sequences juxtaposed with aeroplanes leaving very little to the imagination. The film seems slightly too long considering the content. I have never been a big fan of the training velociraptors theory to me a predator is a predator. Making them more emotional and communicating with them to the point of a promise seems farcical to me. Dodgsons character portrayal didn't quite work for me his aims and objectives wasn't as clear cut as they should've be in my opinion. So without giving too much of the plot away I'd say this isn't the weakest from the series of films but it's a long way from the strongest too.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm not a Jurassic Park/World fan whatsoever, the franchise doesn't do much for me. However I can appreciate the fandom surrounding it and the fact it will always be an iconic part of cinema.....especially for the ""blockbuster"". The original Jurassic Park films are a mixed bag, slowly dropping off in quality as the franchise goes on. Same can be said for the Jurassic World films, the first one was solid although not as good as some of the ""originals"". Whereas majority of ""Fallen Kingdom"" was a swing and miss for me.<br/><br/>Did I really care or have any expectations from this film? No, is the answer.......just don't be bad!!<br/><br/>Erm......sadly this film is pretty shocking and not in the good sense! For me this film is just so lazy from a story point of view. There is some attempt at trying to portray some sort of cohesive story to do with crops and famine. However its glossed over a lot of the time by either ridiculous dialogue, character decisions and an emphasis on dinosaur fights!<br/><br/>Instead of the writers and director focusing on nostalgia with the ""legacy"" characters returning or making a product that will look great at some theme park.....they needed to pay more attention to making a solid film that was interesting, new, cohesive and had stakes!<br/><br/>""Dominion"" to me feels like the studio and producers of these films have tried to squeeze the very last amount of juice out of the Jurassic Park/World tube. However it just comes across as bland, boring, overused and already seen in this franchise!<br/><br/>I just really hope that this is the last film they are gonna make in this franchise and give it a well earn rest. Give it 20 years and then maybe revisit it through a new lease and make something bold and new from it !!<br/><br/>30% out of 100.<br/><br/>PS - Chris Pratt earned a good pay check out off this film, majority of it just holding is hand out looking serious lol!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">So this movie is just plain terrible. But I am such a fan I can't give it a 1. Especially with the original characters coming back. But that is all they had going for them. The director tried really hard to recreate scenes that worked for him in Jurassic world but the rest fell flat. When I saw Owen on a horse I was out. This movie sucked balls. And I own multiple Jurassic park shirts.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's finally summer and it's that time of the year where you just want to be entertained. Who cares if it's not critically acclaimed when it jumps you out of your seat (a handful of times actually)! It was nostalgia all over again to see the original cast (and a couple of good additions) - so good. 'Watched it on IMAX 3D and it was a total blast!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Too many wanna-be film critics on here expecting every movie to be the next shawshank redemption. Take it for what it is - fun, predictable adventure movie with dinosaurs. It's not trying to take you on an emotional roller-coaster or keep you in constant suspense. I enjoyed it, and if you will go into it expecting it to be similar to the first 2 instalments of Jurassic World - you won't be disappointed.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really had high hopes for this film after seeing the first trailer. I didn't watch any of the trailers after that because they give away the whole movie in the trailers and the last two movies were completely spoiled for me by the trailers. But it looked very good. I was able to watch it a week before it came out because it was available online and we you turn down the opportunity to put it on my buddy's big screen out by his pool. I was extremely disappointed after seeing the first time. When I watched it in theaters I wasn't as disappointed as I was originally. First off I still think the third film is the worst. This is definitely not that bad. But even though the Jurassic world movies are not masterpieces, they are still very enjoyable. My issue with them is there's just way too much cgi. Although I will say that the CGI on this phone is phenomenal. The best I've ever seen. The giganotosaurus mixed with the cover of darkness, looks phenomenal. The detail of it all is amazing. Bringing back the old characters and mixing with the new was fun and bringing some old stories full circle was as well. Having Dodgson go down the way he did was perfect. I was really really disappointed that they did not kill Henry wu. No reason he should have survived. I don't care about character arc. But the story was very sloppy. They tried to fit way too much into this movie. My biggest issue with the new films is that if you look at the old movies there's action but they're not like cheesy action Blockbuster films. These films are. They have unrealistic technology and I'm not just talking about like cloning. That's understandable because of what the movie is about. But these people have like 20 trillion dollar facilities. It's just like in the movie The meg. In real life there aren't state-of-the-art facilities like that. I mean there's state of the art facilities but this looks like it's 70 years in the future with the kind of stuff that they have. Whereas in the original film the technology matched what the real world had. But there was just so much stuff that was unrealistic in this and it was a big let down. The dialogue was cheesy at times the story was just garbage. While I do think it's worth the watch and I will see it again and it's not as bad as the third film, it is not very good. I think fallen Kingdom was much better than this as well as Jurassic world but this was definitely the worst of Jurassic world franchise.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World: Dominion is the third (and probably the last) instalment in the Jurassic World trilogy. This movie entails how the world is going to cope with the arrival of dinosaurs in our own environment as well as the power of genetics. We are introduced to not only how our society is coping with the arrival of dinosaurs but also how the dinosaurs are coping with us.<br/><br/>Although it has an enormous amount of cameos and call-backs from the original Jurassic Park trilogy, it just feels like it is missing something, almost like the spark that fuelled this 6 movie franchise. I love Jurassic Park, as well as the original characters, but it was missing something. However, I do feel that it was a bit rushed in places and was not too dinosaur-heavy as the previous films. This film is basically entailing the grand scheme of things, how our society and environment is changing due to the arrival of dinosaurs and how we can co-exist with them. After 5 films we finally get to see dinosaurs co-existing with humans. I think this is a good finale (?) to the Jurassic Park franchise, but it was missing something, still a really enjoyable film with lots of nostalgia for die-hard fans.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">85/100<br/><br/>Firstly, this is in no way comparable to TROS. Sure there are parallels, last of the 'saga' returning characters, but unlike TROS, these characters aren't shoehorned into the movie like Lando was. If anything this movie resembles TFA with its returning cast.<br/><br/>Dominion is criticised for its meshing of two separate plots together and whilst I agree that there was too much preparation for the merge of the stories rather than having a fleshed-out final act, I don't see it as a huge problem with this film.<br/><br/>For me the worst part about the film was the soundtrack, a lot of the music just seemed off, and as stated in IGN's review, the best bits of sound came from edited versions of John Williams' score. The score lets this movie down quite a bit. And a few sloppy lines of dialogue from the actors/actresses are noticeable but apart from that, I found this movie pretty fun and interesting.<br/><br/>It's not what people expected from this 'finale' but I like the idea and the direction they went for this movie. The characters feel right for the movie. Franklin's character, albeit in a smaller role has proved a massive glow-up from his fallen kingdom role. He became likable. Maisy is hit or miss but I was fine with her portrayal and the new characters, especially Ramsey were great.<br/><br/>As for the dinosaur scenes, I think the vast increase in new dinosaurs was awesome! So many new faces and creatures, a lot of Giganotosaurus action which was great to see, and even Rexy got some good screen time. It's a shame they cut the prologue to this movie, but the film is quite long so it is understandable, maybe they'll have some more deleted scenes on the DVD release.<br/><br/>Both the VFX and the Practical effects are well done, for the most part, you won't notice any of the lesser quality CGI unless you really slow the movie down and this is just not fair to criticise because why would you slow down a fast-paced action scene to .25 of a second.<br/><br/>Overall, this film will divide opinions, I know many aren't pleased with the film, especially critics. But if you want an entertaining, unique, and new take on the Jurassic saga, this is the first movie since JPIII that attempts something that isn't a complete remaster of an already produced story. I think that this movie is good, it has flaws but for what we get, it's great. It's better than fallen kingdom (a movie I actually enjoyed) and for that, it ranks as my third favourite movie of the 6.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm not sure if anything pleases people anymore. I had a blast at this movie. Great cast, and some dynamic action scenes. What's not to like? Okay it's a bit long, big deal. We need the distraction. Our country is in the toilet, and I for one welcome anything that takes my mind off of that. I think this was the best of the trilogy. I seriously am baffled at the low score on here. I give up.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I know you have to leave reality at the door when you see these films but at least the first one, made from a great book which helps, made you feel like it maybe could happen. This film is just so ridiculous in places that they have lost any even sniff of believability a long way behind.<br/><br/>With this film they seemed to have tried to cram in as many dinosaurs, scary moments and old characters as they can, then tried to find a weak story to fit it all together.<br/><br/>Not the greatest wat to end the franchise.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">How to distill my feelings towards this movie and the trilogy as a whole; near the end SPOILERS the overarching villain of the series dies by Dilophosaurus in more or less the same way as Nedry, &amp; while watching this scene play out in the theatre I could only sigh.... it wants his death to be poetic justice but comes of as utterly contrived, wholly out of nowwhere; last time we'd seen these animals in this movie they were at a completely different place so why are they here now? Well, just to kill of this one character...
In the end things just happen; every single encounter with a dinosaur 'just happens': pyroraptor, therizinosaurus, giganoto, t-rex, whatever, they just come along to pretend a horror scene....
The overal plot with the bugs, Apple headquarters and Tim Cook aesthetic is all here to rehash the JP's themes but fails by being too on the nose and bland, being tickled but never deepened...
To illustrate what a mess this movie is, just take a good look at the opening montage, which features the quetzalcoatlus nesting on top of a skyscraper, however, this reptile had never been featured before nor do we no it escaped or was bred beforehand, no, this animal escaped near the end of the movie by plot point, so why is it here? No one knows &amp; the movie doesn't really bother telling u.<br/><br/>Is it better than Fallen Kingdom? Definitely; that movie tried to wink so much at the movies before it it became a parody, but Dominion, while doing less such things, is still bad...
Thank U for the new dinosaurs though, as I will thoroughly enjoy putting them in parks in Jurassic World Evolution 2, but I'm glad this trilogy is done... please do not reboot the original, it ain't artistically worth it;</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">If I wasn't such a huge fan of dinosaurs and held the original Jurassic Park (and 2+3, I know sue me) then this would've been given 6 stars. I enjoyed seeing the dinosaurs that was probably my favourite part of the movie, that and Alan Grant of course, that's when they were on screen anyway and not giant locus. It definitely lacked that feel of dinosaurs being everywhere overall as they decided to make it cricket focused instead for some reason and to have a big bad be the science corporations and not the dinosaurs running around which is what I would have preferred. The movie was also kind of messy with many plots going on all at once with some cheesy dialogue thrown in. I wanted to love this movie but they made a really uninteresting plot that still could've been better. The dinosaurs were great though I loved seeing all the unique species to this movie and even got some surprises in there too. I loved seeing the dinosaurs around the real world and co existing or at least trying to, I thought that made for a really unique couple of scenes. I definitely enjoyed the movie but if I wanted to watch it again I'd probably skip to the scenes with the dinosaurs I liked as the plot was all over the place. To be fair I only come to see dinosaurs in these movies and action scenes of sorts and I definitely got them but overall it was only brief moments in the entirety of the movie. I hope they do more and make a movie about the dinosaurs living among the humans more. I do have to say the cinematography with the dinosaurs was really beautiful on the screen and the music was great which I found out at the end to be the same person who did the Batman music. Anyway for now I'll stick to the original trilogy.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't believe how much I hated this movie. I considered leaving within the first 5 minutes, but stopped thinking it might get better. It didn't...it just got worse and worse. It was boring, dumbed-down, clunky, and had a muddled storyline. What really shocked me was how awful the dinosaurs looked. They looked about as good as the low-budget dinosaurs on a show my children watch. What made the movie painful was that it was so long on top of the awful script. I kept looking at the time to see how much longer until the torture would be over. Not even the original Jurassic World trio could save this movie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Where to begin? Was this sixth installment a let down on all fronts? Yes. The plot is so nonsensical and complicated that it makes the original seem like high art. The dialogue is stilted and off-putting. And you can't escape the fact the actors seem to be sleep walking their way through the movie, and who could blame them? There is not one single awe inspiring visual or moment. Just a cash grab wrapped in nostalgia and served at a dismil level. At this point, there seems absolutely no where for this series to go, except extinction.</div>

But The other two were brilliant, Claire and Maisy were much improved over the last film(s). I only wish the mosasaurs had something to do in the film and blue and also Henry Wu as they had all been built up to but in the finally they didn't really have much to do.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie starts out decent but looses steam quickly. As the story and plot develops(lack of development really) the movie all of sudden starts going into many different directions. There are about 8 different plot points and most of them don't interest me. I don't like how the director introduced the cloned human in the previous film, and that characters plot carries over into this movie and is extremely boring and uninteresting. Most moments where there is supposed to be tension or suspense falls flat I will say on a positive note there are many different types of dinos in the film and that's always cool to see. Jeff Goldblum is great and Sam Neil and Laura Dern aren't bad either, everyone else in this movie is mediocre at best. .</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Nothing can probably beat what the first Jurassic Park caused, first because it was a pioneer movie in bringing the theme of dinosaurs, and second because of its amazing visual effects. But anyway there was a reinvention of the franchise with Jurassic World that worked very well. This latest installment also has the added bonus of bringing the original cast together with the current one, which makes it a unique product. The movie has everything from chases in European cities, snow scenes, mysterious caves, new dinosaurs, monstrous insects, dangers on Isla Nublar etc etc. But it also has some homage scenes to that charming first film, with frames almost traced. Many believe they see repeated things but in reality they are deliberately made so that the viewer instantly connects with their childhood, adolescence or youth according to how old they were in the 90s. The second half of the movie does not give us respite and we see our heroes in constant dangers. To buy a bucket of popcorn and sit down to enjoy the adventure.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Look I know the plot of this movie is all over the place but tbh. I really liked and enjoyed it. Jurassic Park was my childhood, I've watched it so many times and seeing the OG Cast finally back on the big screen made me soo happy. Also I'm a huge Dino-Nerd, so I'm maybe a little bit biased.<br/><br/>I really liked that some lesser known or non mainstream ""dinos"" got the spotlight. The chemistry between the old and new cast worked great. There are many shots/scenes which are really cinematic and look absolutely gorgeous.<br/><br/>Overall story/plot is okay but messy, great cast and chemistry, cool dinosaurs that usually don't get enough spotlight, some really cool looking scenes which I would love to have as a wallpaper and lots of fanservice and callbacks to the old movies.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This seemed like it was a complete cash grab on the backs of previous titles.<br/><br/>Writing, script was horrible made the actors look bad even though they were fine in previous films.<br/><br/>It seemed like there were 8 plot lines and none followed through with a proper storyline. They just took the easy way out with each plot line. The storyline was all over the place and nothing tied together properly. Tried to incorporate all the previous world famous scenes from the original Jurassic Park instead of creating a decent story. It seemed like they must of had 8 amateur writers, have them work separately and then jam it into one movie with out fleshing out a decent story.<br/><br/>The cgi was horrible and the green screen and animatronics were worse than they were 10 years ago. It was like watching a film that was made 20 years ago, even the horse riding was cgi and bad.<br/><br/>Such a poor film haven't seen one this bad in many, many years.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've now seen the film twice. Went in the first time with zero expectations and decently enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Second time, watched more critically and noticed all of the cons.<br/><br/>There are some great moments and action sequences but that's about it. A lot of good ideas but very poor execution which led to it feeling very rushed.<br/><br/>The prior movie setup the whole idea of a world of humans and dinosaurs co-existing and they almost abandoned that idea right out of the gate for a jumbled mess of ideas and plot lines that just didn't gel well together. We've seen the same troupes in these films time after time. ""Oh hey look! The t-rex is here to save the day"", ""We need to have blue in this film or else we won't be able to sell more toys"", etc. While nice to pay homage and see a bit of nostalgia, that's not enough... sorry. It'd be nice if Hollywood actually took a chance and tried something new in this tired series or focused solely on a single plot line instead of mashing a ton of ideas together and hoping it'll work.<br/><br/>This ""film"" felt more like a fan-fiction than anything.<br/><br/>It has none of the suspense and thriller aspects that the original ""Jurassic Park"" series was known for that, I felt, left many fans severely disappointed. You lost the magic of what made all of its predecessors enjoyable just to pop out another cash grab Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>As many other critics said, the character writing and motivations are poor. The new additions to the cast were fun, particularly the helicopter pilot but there was just too much going on for us to care about or feel a connection with any of them.<br/><br/>Same goes to the returning cast from the original franchise. It was wonderful to see them again but they were literally given almost NOTHING to do. They literally could have been replaced with any other character and you would have never known. Just a disservice and poor use.<br/><br/>I hope they leave it here and let this series finally rest. 6/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Spoiler free: This movie looked great but overall it's a giant mess. There was so much potential bringing in older characters but the plot is just horrendous. It just didn't have the spark that other sequels had (Maverick and GB:Afterlife). We had high hopes for this one but it fell flat.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Rather than get to see dinosaurs in communities across the world or impacting the very fabric of our lives, we get to learn a whole lot about insects. It is a misguided misdirect as we don't really see how the world has been changed all that much by the prehistoric creatures as the film gets narrower and narrower in focus the more it goes on. All the potential awe and terror of dinosaurs taking over the planet is lost in the shuffle, making for a massively missed opportunity. It is utterly misguided from the outset, doomed by its own inexplicable unwillingness to embrace its potential as it all descends into a dawdling disaster. Life couldn't find a way out of this mess.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Like most who were born in the 1990's I grew up with the original Jurassic Park and would watch it almost endlessly on VHS. It not only entertained, but also sparked my interest in all things dinosaurs and was one of the movies that made me want to be a filmmaker. I am happy that even as I have grown older, and my cinematic tastes have matured I still am able to rate the film highly. I would echo with most regarding the sequels and that they all left much to be desired. The Lost World is entertaining and has some nice world building and spectacle but lacks the charm of its predecessor. Jurassic Park III is essentially one long action set piece with a storyline that is neither interest or very exciting. Jurassic World is essentially the first movie on a larger scale but still is charming and entertaining. Fallen Kingdom has a nice set up but after the island is engulfed into ash it essentially becomes a monster-in-the-house kind of movie. Dominion I am sorry to say is not the complete home run a fan has been hoping for in 29 years.<br/><br/>Dominion has the ambitious task of concluding this trilogy of Jurassic installments, finish the arcs for the new and old casts of characters, and ultimately conclude the franchise as a whole. It aims high but doesn't grasp at the greatness it's hoping to achieve. There is too much going on in the plot that often it feels like two different movies spliced into one. There are so many concepts, themes, characters, and set-ups that it honestly comes across like somebody edited down an entire season of television into a two-and-a-half-hour film - To be honest, I think I would have preferred a series over a movie given how much Colin Trevorrow sets out to do in such a span of time. The cast all do fine, everyone is charismatic, the imagery is often dynamic and fantastic, and the spectacle is often incredible to witness on the big screen, though the wonderment of the original and even The Lost World and to an extent Jurassic World feels almost entirely lost.<br/><br/>Watching the film, I couldn't help but think that Trevorrow learned a lot from his experience with working on the ninth episode of Star Wars and how Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm/Disney. Mismanaged and letdown legions of fans, and when he left and set out to try and avoid the pitfalls of The Rise of Skywalker by trying to give everyone as much as he thought they wanted; he succeeds to an extent, but the overlong runtime and constant juggle of storylines and characters make the more satisfying moments lacking total and complete emotional impact. I don't blame him for trying, especially given that Fallen Kingdom wasn't as well liked as Jurassic World and trying to make a picture that pleases every fan is satisfying as well. I wish it had worked out in his favor, but alas.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">2hrs and 20 mins was way too long and somehow still not long enough to coherently fit in all the crazy storylines that they tried to pull off. Notably these weren't focused on dinosaurs and the writers chose not to pick up on the story line (involving dinosaurs) that was teased at the end the previous film and in the marketing material. I gave up on the story and started watching it scene for scene.<br/><br/>So many characters (old and new), so many storylines but not a whole deal of action and very few memorable moments. An underwhelming conclusion to the saga. Some of the dinosaurs looked cool though!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">...you may not have understood what Fallen Kingdom was trying to say. Ian clearly calls out genetic power and what we're to happen if it circled the globe. Cataclysmic change like death and while most feel it was a metaphor for climate change, it was actually a warning of the locusts. The technology learned from dinos being applied to something seemingly without worry turning Into a global disaster. I'm sure you can read other things Into it if you want but looking at it from a pure plot written standpoint, it was a fitting storyline to add.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film , solid acting, directing and action. I think the idea of keeping the prologue separate from the film turned out to be a bad one as it would have played out better as the start of the movie. The beginning is a bit off because of it but what comes after is fantastic. I hope Universal provides a directors cut or whatever the original vision was because it would make a difference. Solid 8 out of 10 and I plan to see it again as It's easily worth the price of admission!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am a fan of the Jurassic Park movies, but this one was a let down. For me this one was the worst of the lot. No real story, predictable and repeated scenes, same old dialogues, and 1 hour too long.<br/><br/>It may have done better without the first 60 minutes of nothing. A couple of chase sequences were done really well, gripping stuff, but that's all the good I can say about this as the rest of the movie was boring rehash and uninspiring.<br/><br/>Also, in 2022 the special effects were a let down as most dinosaurs looked clayish and lifeless. Something wrong with the texture detailing, the eyes and muscular controls. I hope this dud does not kill the series.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you didn't watch any other Jurassic movies before, then maybe you can enjoy it. I could not.<br/><br/>Overall this movie feels like they cut previous Jurassic movies apart, added big locusts, and glued it together again.<br/><br/>Also dinosaurs sometimes at lightning speed, and other times they move almost in slowmotion. Feels
extremely inconsistent and without any sense of realism.<br/><br/>Why humanity couldn't deal with the dinosaurs that got released into the wild 30 years earlier, before this movie takes place, is baffling. Only the smaller species could potentially go under the radar and survive if we decided to annihilate them.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I managed to do something I haven't done in a long time, and that's not see a single movie trailer or preview going into Jurassic World Dominion. Which I am thankful for that I was able to enjoy a lot of the scenes that would have been spoiled in the trailers. The movie was watchable, enjoyable to see everyone together, great to see all the dinosaurs, how they would effect everyday human life, and felt the right length, but that's about it. Seemed like everyone of our old favorites was only fronting the effort and there wasn't much energy.<br/><br/>Story line doesn't really make sense. A lot unnecessary plot holes. Obsession with the clone girl from the last movie and as always, Raptor DNA. Never really explained how a few dozen dinosaurs escaping in California are able to spread world wide other than ""illegal breeders"" and ""poaching"".<br/><br/>They do the same tired Trex vs another apex predator rivalry fight yet this is the worst match up of all the movies. They make the Giganotosaurus to be the bad guy vs the Trex for no reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>The entire movie revolves around genetically modifying giant prehistoric locust and releasing them on the world and how the crazy Steve Jobs megalomaniac was the only one that didn't see how bad that was. Sadler and Grant need to get a sample from inside to prove the connection? Really? No government in the world could investigate or make the connection that the company involved with giant prehistoric dinosaur DNA might also be the ones responsible for the giant genetically modified locusts?<br/><br/>I will saw that the variety dinosaurs we saw were great to watch. #Justice for the deer that got yeeted for no reason while minding its own business.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">There's a lot going on and no real solution in the end. The story with Maisie was interesting enough and Claire with Zia and Franklin at the beginning. After that it tends to fall.<br/><br/>Owen survives a plane crash without a seatbelt and falls into ice water without any damage. He holds out his hands to many dinosaurs and most of the time the dinos stop. He is definitely a Marty Stu.<br/><br/>Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler seem just tired and have barely any enthusiasm from their first film characters. They also have a forced love relationship which doesn't feel at all earned.<br/><br/>Ian Malcom barely does anything.<br/><br/>Lewis Dodgson is the most evil character in the book. Attempts to murder Sarah Harding and breaks a dinosaurs leg with no remorse. Well here, he has no relation to the character other than name sake. He is what I perceived a jab at Tim Cook from Apple. Even the complex is trying to replicate Apple Park.<br/><br/>Henry Wu does a 180° and is a good guy without having earned it.<br/><br/>There's many cringe scenes but the fact they even cameoed the logo of the film with the T Rex was just too much.<br/><br/>I would have them do a 4th film just to fix this mess of a story they created. Nothing has changed from the end of Fallen Kingdom.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had hopes this was a different film than the other Trevorrow Jurassic World sequels, especially with the legacy Jurassic Park cast members making a comeback. I was wrong. The opening scene immediately sets the tone by spoon-feeding the audience Chris Pratt wrangling and taming a wild dinosaur. There is no cleverly sagacious writing here, just more explosions and dinosaur fight club from Trevorrow. The plot almost works, but feels too synthetic in having no point but to involve original cast members. The fundamental issue with the film is that, for all the grasping at nostalgia, the story is simply not set in the same world as where we want to see or remember the characters in.<br/><br/>While the girls and bicurious Disney fans in love with Chris Pratt may like the movie, the older adults who vividly remember and cherish the first Jurassic Park as one of their favorite movies will be glad this franchise has finally been euthanized.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurrassic Park was a Pop Culture masterpiece. Sequels will not recapture that initial magic. However I found Jurassic World Dominion fun and satisfying for the most part. It was great to see the union and reunion of past and present characters. There were nice character arcs and cool dinosaurs and action scenes. That's all I needed. I'm not sure why the critics raged it so poorly. Most average viewers enjoyed it. Just enjoy it for what it is.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Most positive reviews of the movie seem to focus on the action, dinosaurs, and jump scares. I won't deny that the movie has them. The only thing missing was a connecting thread.<br/><br/>Fans of the series who were amazed by the storytelling of the first movie will be severely disappointed. There seems to be no cohesive storyline and the scenes felt like they were all thrown into a hat and pulled out randomly.<br/><br/>Some scenes were totally ridiculous, especially with the Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus, and Therizinosaurus (yes, that's what it's called). Some were great like the herding with horses scene. But the movie failed to deliver despite having a treasure trove of opportunity to do so.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If they had focused more on how awesome it would of looked day to day for Dinosaurs and animals and humans co-existed after the previous films. It could have been jaw dropping.<br/><br/>So many characters the dinosaurs were more like extras!<br/><br/>This is the first film I had no jumps or felt zero tension.<br/><br/>Thank god we finally saw the Dimetrodon.<br/><br/>I just wish after films the plesiosaur got some screen time.<br/><br/>Sad it was in production this long and we got an action film not a dinosaur film.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The supposed ""problem"" of the film was not the highlight of the film, it was treated as an after thought.

It's an ok movie, was honestly expecting more.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The CGI was garbage and the puppets from Jurassic Park looked more realistic. The plot was basically bugs overtaking the world and the characters were ruined. Owen got hardly any lines and the only good character was Ian Malcom with his humor. They did horrible proportions with the dinos and they greatly reduced the intelligence of the raptors<br/><br/>Although it was cool, the bad outweighed the cool.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Oh dear. The reviews are right. Too long by at least 30mins, this is an overblown mess from start to finish. The old crew are shoehorned in, while Pratt and BDH reliably perform their usual schtick. Has one of the best action sequences in the entire franchise, and copious 1993 Easter Eggs. Some good moments, and interesting ideas, but very loud. It's quiet time now. 6/10.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World Dominion, the third entry in the Jurassic World series and sixth film in the overall franchise, unites the current and original cast together for a big symphonic finish.<br/><br/>In the words of John Hammond, the film spares no expense at delivering spectacle and thrills. Unfortunately, Dominion buckles under its own weight from too many characters and the story ultimately falls under the law of diminishing returns from having nothing new to say.<br/><br/>At the end of Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, dinosaurs have been let loose and are free roaming across the Earth, living alongside humans. I was expecting Dominion to explore this fresh untapped narrative.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's not the story we get. Dominion is another story of corporate greed about genetically-bred locusts that's endangering the world's food supply. Maisie Lockwood, the clone daughter of Sir Benjamin Lockwood from the previous film, may hold the key to saving the world.<br/><br/>Imagine buying a ticket to see dinosaurs. You see the movie and you're like, ""Hey man, where are my dinosaurs?"" The movie goes, ""Look! Locusts!""<br/><br/>It is disappointing on some level. From the trailers, I was imagining the old and current cast teaming up, saving both humans and dinosaurs from each other across the globe, ensuring peace between the two like X-men, but with dinosaurs. ""D-men"", if you will. The script practically writes itself.<br/><br/>Do not fret though. There are plenty of dinosaurs in Dominion despite not being the narrative focus. The dinosaurs are obstacles that the characters have to survive through in the film's numerous set pieces.<br/><br/>The action is well done. The standout sequence is a Mission Impossible-like motorcycle chase with raptors through the streets of Malta. New dinosaurs also provide some nail-biting suspenseful moments.<br/><br/>There are too many characters; that is 6 lead characters, and 5 supporting characters all fighting for screentime. The two characters that I cared about, and wished the film focused more on, were Sam Neil and Laura Dern's characters. One of the biggest disappointments in Jurassic Park 3 was learning that Alan Grant and Ellie Satler split up. Dominion attempts to mend that with a love story that it doesn't devote enough time towards.<br/><br/>Dr. Ian Malcolm's part was disappointing. Even though he had an active role, Jeff Goldblum had nothing to react to or anything clever to say. His performance felt off as it seemed like he took an extra beat than needed.<br/><br/>The Jurassic World films are in a repetitive story loop that the Fox's X-men franchise was once in. Similar to Magneto, Dr. Henry Wu, the true villain of the franchise, is always conveniently let go to keep the story going and for the same conflict to repeat. Dr. Wu should be branded as a known international criminal and jailed in a psychiatric ward by now for the havok he was brought in the last 3 films.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion was advertised as the end of the new trilogy. There just wasn't any finality to any of it. You'll remember the action scenes but ultimately forget what happened story-wise.</div>

But its a fantastic thank you to the fans.<br/><br/>With tons of nods to the original, a great collection of dinosaurs, beautiful well made animatronics, great music, great acting and fun action.<br/><br/>Dominion is a love letter to the OG of the series. The returning characters are a nice touch and the new returning cast does a fantastic job with some hearthfelth moments.<br/><br/>Objectivly speaking this would be more of a 6/10 - 7/10.<br/><br/>But with the added fan service, solid acting and dinosaurs. It raises its score for me. If you like jurassic park, you will enjoy this !</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Story is based on one thing mostly - how to survive if a bloodthirsty predator lures around you. But it's OK actually, scenes are thrilling, dinosaurs are vivid and look real. Nice to see known characters again and follow the path how dinosaurs and people will coexist on Earth.<br/><br/>Best escape award: Bryce Dallas Howard vs the Therizinosaurus (long-clawed dino).</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I question those trying to find the meaning of life and Academy Award performances from a dinosaur movie. I found the movie quite entertaining and true to the original Jurassic Park concept. The movie lines up with the old Saturday afternoon thrillers, monster movies and science fiction epics. The movie is fun. That is all one really needs to know.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">TBH, I wasn't expecting much from this movie as movies these days don't hold any potential but I extremely loved how they made connections with previous movies of the franchise and gave us this masterpiece.<br/><br/>All the actors and crew did and excellent job along with special effect team. Effects were amazing and no doubt this was best film in the whole franchise. Loved the scenes with THE BIGS ONCE, the tension and fear built for them in that particular scene was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/><br/>Must watch. Thank You.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">My my my, where to begin?<br/><br/>Original JP - one of my top 5 movies of all time. Seen it more times than I can count. ""When you gotta go, you gotta go"" ""Clever girl"" ""hold on to your butts"" are regular sayings of mine. Wish I could go back again and again and see it for the first time. Perfection. Amazing. You get it.<br/><br/>JP 2 - horrible! Rexy in LA? Pfft.<br/><br/>JP 3 - eh, was ok at best. Back on dino turf. Brought back my fav, Dr. Grant tho. It's def doable.<br/><br/>Reboots w Pratt. 1st? Decent. 2nd? Meh.<br/><br/>But we come to Word Domination aka JP 6 - what in the heck. Who green lighted this? Who wrote this script? Who? Why? What?<br/><br/>I think they spliced together about 4 different movies and called it a day. I can't even pinpoint the worst part. Oh wait, yeah. The whole portion of the movie when they are in Malta. The cliche blond Asian / British chick has GOT to be one of the worst characters I've seen in a LONG time. And her acting was actually cringe, When they first showed her out of the car I thought ""I didn't know Lady Gaga was in this!?"" Dressed to the hilt to tromp around with a child that's been kidnapped while within the same hour transferring methodical raptors on steroids that will do anything, and I mean anything, to chase and kill anyone that she shines her cat laser on. When the dude tells her to ""freeze"" theres like a 3 second delay in her stopping and awkwardly turning. It was so, so bad. Like an SNL skit. Not to mention she's like 2 feet away from them but didn't notice till he says freeze. Hah!<br/><br/>The over the top missions and actions of the main cast, but especially Chris Pratt is SUCH a joke. Just one, after the other, after the other, after the other. Did nobody see any issues with this? The motorcycle chase through a foreign country, whilst being chased by Gaga's laser Dino's, to jumping onto the moving plane (which I'm throughly impressed with him knowing exactly where to go to find this said plane in a place they have never, ever been to before) and of course, right in the nick of time! Then he survives the airplane crash, the fall through the ice with the chicken raptor that is clearly an avid swimmer, the countless encounters with the ""apex predators"" yadda yadda boring boring.<br/><br/>Does time and distance not exist in this new dino/human sharing world? Go from the woods of Oregon or whatever, to DC, or whatever, to the streets of Malta within a day? Then the plane crash, to deep in the jungle of dino infested woods to find his woman, within...what 10,20 min? The whole cast is able to get, what looks to be a 1-2 day hike at minimum, without breaking a sweat.<br/><br/>Did anyone realize with in the first 5 movies Dr. Wu and Dr. Sadler were horrible actors?? I didn't.<br/><br/>The locust? Why was this not called Locust: World Domination? They have about the same amount of screen time, if not more than all the Dino's combined. And the whole movie basically centers around them. The Dino's are just background actors.<br/><br/>They glossed right over the fact A WOMAN WAS ABLE TO GET HERSELF PREGNANT!? What!?<br/><br/>How does a young girl, aged 10 - living with 2 Americans STILL have her thick British accent 4 years later?? What!?<br/><br/>Didn't the last movie explain she was a clone of Lockwoods granddaughter THAT DIED IN A CAR CRASH when she was a child? Not a prolific, scholar of a scientist that spoke at colleges, and was able to replace a chromosome in her daughter - THAT SHE CONCEIVED ALL ALONE - and eradicate a full on deadly disease in her. Why was this hidden? Why could this girl not know this?<br/><br/>What was good about this movie you may ask? Baby Blue. Baby Blue was flippin adorable. Period.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and save 2.5 hours of your life, from this jumbled up mess.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Directed by Colin Trevorrow. Starring Chris Pratt as ""Owen Grady"", Bryce Dallas Howard as ""Claire Dearing"". Which starred in the last three films. They also brought back Laura Dern as ""Ellie Sattler"", Sam Neill as ""Alan Grant"" and Jeff Goldblum as ""Ian Malcolm from the original three films.<br/><br/>This is the third and final film in the ""Jurassic World"" franchise. Wrapping up the entire franchise as a whole. Now in this film ""Claire"" and ""Owen"" are hiding out and taking up a parent role with the clone of ""Maisie Lockwood"" played by Isabella Sermon. The company that helped make her wants her back. ""Claire"" and ""Owen"" also trying to do their part in wrangling in wild dinasours and bringing them to ""Lewis Dodgson"" played by Campbell Scott. A Tim Cook doppelgänger in the film.<br/><br/>Because of the events from the last film dinosaurs are every where. They are apart of normal life now. Which also made an extreme black market for them on top of the rare breeding and genetic tampering. ""Lewis"" company ""Biotech"" made a Sanctuary that the dinasaurs can go to and be safe. While he also does leading edge stuff to cure diseases with his company. But the genius billionaire has a little more to him then the naked eye can see.<br/><br/>After ""Blue"" the Velociraptor ""Owen"" trained in the earlier films and has a bond with, had a child. Now ""Maisie"" and ""Blue"" child are in grave danger because of their uniqueness. Some other shady stuff is going on from ""Biotech"" which brings the original cast together with the help of a inside man ""Ramsay Cole"" played by Mamoudou Athie.<br/><br/>""Owen"" and ""Claire"" receive some help from their old friends ""Dr. Zia"", ""Franklin"", and ""Barry"". Played by Daniella Pineda, Justice Smith, and Omar Sy. Along with a new friend they picked up on the way ""Kayla Watts"" played by DeWanda Wise from ""She's Gotta Have it"".<br/><br/>Some how the old and the new mash up together. Of course finding themselves knee deep in dinosaur trouble.<br/><br/>""Jurassic World: Dominion"" was a good bad film or a bad good film. Whichever way you want to put it. They put all the money in the CGI and left no money for the script. The Transitions were really bad. Some of the plot points made no sense or were just bad. Even connecting characters in the film. It looks and feels like we don't know a good way to get these people in one location so we're just going to write anything. I felt like no effort went into the script.<br/><br/>I say all that to say the graphics were amazing. The action scenes were gripping and fun. I felt like I was in the film and Velociraptors were chasing me. Those scenes were amazing. The volume and sheer power of the bigger dinosaurs just amazed me. This film was so thrilling and entertaining.<br/><br/>If it involved humans majority of the time it was odd and scenes that made no sense. They were forcing the fact they combined both of the franchises. They Re-enacted multiple scenes from the original films in this film. At first it was really cool. But after the third one it was like ok I get it. I see what your doing there. I loved when we first saw ""Grant"" and ""Ellie"" but they took all the nostalgia out of it because of how hard they were forcing things.<br/><br/>Overall you should see this film on the biggest screen possible. Just know that the action is great and the dinosaurs look so good they'll feel real. You will be entertained, but the script is very bad. By the time your losing focus and coming to the realization this makes no sense something cool happens to take your mind off of how bad the transitions are. Oh and you can't forget the ""Where's Waldo"" of the franchise ""Dr. Henry Wu played by BD Wong. They were wrong for how they ended that characters storyline. I give this film three mor fires 🔥🔥🔥.<br/><br/>#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well what a waste of my Saturday watching that rubbish that's got to be the worse one yet
But to be honest they should of stopped after the first one
Stop making these films now
The old members came back and they even where ancient dinosaurs and where terrible massive flop
I heard one lady in the cinema saying what a brilliant film I honestly thick she was drunk or blind
This film is lucky to get a 3 star from me
You could even tell some of the dinosaurs where plastic models with remote control eyes 😆</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am a huge Jurassic fan. I had my doubts about this movie going into it. I was sure the dialogue would be cheesy, the plot rushed and riddled with holes. Trevorrow is a good director, not so much a good screenwriter. I was anxious about the Malta scenes. Worried about there being too many characters.<br/><br/>That being said..... it all worked for me.<br/><br/>Comparing all these movies to the OG is where the problem lies. Everyone criticizes these newer films for not being the original one. But we've already HAD the original Jurassic Park. If there's another original, it can't be THE original. I don't know what people expect to happen in a situation where dinosaurs are literally everywhere. Could there have been more focus on peoples' everyday interactions with said dinosaurs and fewer interactions with giant locusts? Sure.<br/><br/>I liked the dialogue much more than I thought I would. The original cast worked pretty well for me here. I enjoyed the action. I actually felt connected to Owen and Claire for the first time in this film. Owen wasn't as stone-faced this film as he was the first two. Really enjoyed Dodgson. The music was great.<br/><br/>All in all, this is my new favorite film from the JW trilogy, whether or not it lives up to the expectations of others.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""Jurassic World Dominion"" is a boring film, where the dinosaurs aren't the main character !!!<br/><br/>We can see them for 10 minutes in the film, where the principal thing that we should see are the dinosaurs. The dialogues are terrible and the cast is composed by unable people: the young cast doesn't have an objective, the girl is unbearable, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are boring and not credible. About the old cast, they don't know why and how they are finished in this movie. They act like they don't care about the movie, above all Sam Neill!<br/><br/>The villain is one of the worst character that I have ever seen and there isn't a final: there isn't a conclusion about the characters that have representated this trilogy and not.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think that this is one of the worst movie of 2022 and the worst movie of the jurassic saga. A real shame!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The only thing i really liked about the movie was the ending which had some cool scenes. The movie felt empty, generic and unsurprising. As seen in teasers the cast of the Jurassic Park movies were introduces without a wow element so to speak, the movie felt rushed even when it has quite a runtime and nothing really made sense as someone else has also reviewed.<br/><br/>Scenes did not make sense, the hand thing from Owen was weird and overused as if that does anything with a predator dinosaur... The threat from them was also non existent. I wanted to love this movie but simply could not. The 'getting the gang back together' trope could have worked allot better had they taken more time in making the plot more clear.<br/><br/>I would wait to see it until it shows on a streaming service so you don't waste your money on a film ticket.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Entertaining, but it just doesn't feel like a finale for such an iconic property. They just opened up too many doors in this universe that I wanted to explore. Definitely not saying it ended poorly... I left the theater saying it was good, and so did my family. Just thought there would be an Avengers level threat for the last chapter (not that food shortage is some joke, just saying villain wise).<br/><br/>Sure, it probably would have been better if it was more of a ""dinosaur"" contained series, but pandora's box was opened and now I want to see some more clones and genetically modified monsters.<br/><br/>And It's always nice to see our favorite lizard king, the Antagonist-Rex tag in a partner before biting the big one, even if it is some forest creeper this time. But I was hoping for a redemption arc for the Spinosaurus, guess it'll never be.<br/><br/>Gotta say, though... probably the best car chase (motorcycle) scene I've scene in a film. And there were lots of other cool scenes mixed with humor and emotional elements. So not bad at all... just way different from the original (so I can see why people were starting to dislike the franchise). But hey, life finds a way. #evolution.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">So Jurassic World Dominion.<br/><br/>Perfect 10/10. Like the first movie the basic plot coulda been done without dinosaurs (in the first movie they could have been done with malfunctioning rides/automated systems/cleaning robots). Its not a thriller per say maybe a heist movie? Its basically Claire and Ellie seeking to infiltrate a corrupt company. The movie has heavy themes of conservation, anti capitalism and preservation of the environment and the villain is basically a Bezos/musk expy whos willing to put millions at risk to make a buck.<br/><br/>So while at its core the movie works as a regular good movie about fighting that situation(albiet not groundbreaking), it still has tons of good character interaction, new dinosaurs , and the heroes instead of being victims cleverly avoiding danger through desperation, teamwork and cleverness (giving the raptor scene int he climax of the final movie vibes).<br/><br/>And there was a ton of fanservice that lovers of the franchise will enjoy. Just like W1 and 2 there are shoutouts and classic camera shots recreated with different context. And i dont think any of them felt forced (Marvel's :Guy steps into the camera, it zooms in on his face :""Its me Blorbo""). 1 Kinda corney moment with Blue, a certain interaction between two characters made me think there was something cut that showed more about the character.<br/><br/>Enjoy!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I read the Jurassic Park books and like all the films, to me this installment leaned more towards feeling like a lite tv pilot to set up a Jurassic live action tv series, or something straight to streaming. There was just something missing. Not enough dinosaurs. Too many characters doing unrealistic things. Side characters that just vanish from the plot and are never addressed again. Iconic signature legacy characters simply trying to deliver their best most familiar recap of their character. The action and carnage was weaker this time around. Navigation of the plot is all over the place. The writing has its corny rushed moments. This film nearly crumbles under the weight of its previous films loose ends and baggage. It tries to be its own thing but staggers through a muddy forced espionage story. Dinosaurs are swept away to the sidelines as background details and decorations who pop up once in a while to say 'boo'. Our human characters aren't interesting nor developed enough while juggling numerous groups of them as characters. This feels like damage control from Fallen Kingdom tanking half this movie. All we see here is a few more of the same familiar thrills and chills, but less epic, and with less to tell. Everything is so rushed with so many sprawling story beats, there's no moment to really soak in the suspense, dread, or beauty of a dinosaur. The writing and excuse to gather the gangs of characters together feels contrived. More of the same. Fun to watch, but underwhelming. I can just say I'm relieved the second trilogy is over. I only hope the next one finds a way.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World turned into Fast and Furious type. Utterly nonsense through all the movie. I can't point a positive thing about this movie. For people who are passionate about Jurassic Park and don't want this film to affect your connection to the 1993 classic, don't watch it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The whole movie could be done without the dinosaurs anyways, the whole plot unfolds around this famine and rescue thing. In the trailer it talks about how human is going to co-live with the dinosaurs but in the end the movie ended abruptly. I don't enjoy at at all, before half of the movie I realized it's not going to be good and turns out I'm right......</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">A 2:26 minute escape from $6 gal gas, Biden, bad news, war. The dinosaurs seemed real and reminded me how maybe we would have been better off had they evolved rather than the shaved apes. Amazing special effects and great action scenes! A very watchable distraction on a Saturday afternoon.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think others have been to harsh. Yes, it's familiar territory but well edited, good acting and some laughs (spot 'The Shining' reference). I thought the running time would be too long but it my attention throughout. Screen time is well shared among the cast and the sub plots work well together. Nice to see Laura and Sam get together at the end and and Isabella Sermon and Wanda deWise are very watchable. Some people really need to chill out and just eat their popcorn...</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Look, obviously there's no comparison to the first film; it was nearly perfect, and this one has flaws. Still, it's by far the best of the sequels.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs look and feel incredible, and in this film they are everywhere. There are a couple main story threads that bring the main characters together, and one is more interesting than the other, but both hold your attention- and once the main characters are together, there is great chemistry there.<br/><br/>They didn't bring the old characters in for a quick cameo at the end, either, they are integral to the plot and drive things forward in their own right.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum, particularly, is just so entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Also, it's nonsense to say this movie is ""woke"" just because they added a young black female character to the cast. She was a good character. A ""Han Solo type"" pilot who doesn't want to get involved but can't help herself.<br/><br/>Then the other half are mad that Chris Pratt was allowed to be in this film even though he's been publicly open about his faith- it must be exhausting to try to entertain people these days.<br/><br/>I brought my 13 year old son to this and I'm so glad I did. This film was a massive spectacle and at the end it felt like we had just finished something special. The long runtime flew by.<br/><br/>I don't know what some reviewers were expecting- perhaps the first film again- this isn't that. But it's fun and tense and amazing. I think it's become in fashion to bash these films (and the last one may have deserved it) but this one is very good.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went in to this movie not expecting it to be groundbreaking or even really good. I had fun watching it but obviously there are issues. At one point in the movie the audience is meant to be tracking four different subplots. It's very messy and overall is kind of a rehash on previous entries to the franchise. It's full of over the top action, strange convinces, and some sketchy acting.<br/><br/>However, I got exactly what I paid for. A silly action movie with dinosaurs in it. It was fine.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have watched all the movies of the World trilogy and have watched camp Cretaceous Netflix series. But this movie ( except it's ending) is easily the best content we ever got from Jurassic world! I am not saying it's even worth a toenail in front of Jurassic park but it's a good movie if you are a dinosaur fan! Just don't look at the inaccuracies and stuff. They handled the original cast very respectfully! The plot is silly but enjoyable unlike fallen kingdom! The characters have an actual sense! Except Crisp Rat and blue ... Ending fight is mid. The mid part of the movie is breathtaking! Vfx is easily better than fallen kingdom! I enjoyed this movie as a fun summer blockbuster dino movie haha. Don't think too deep and you will have a good time!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I would say this is my favorite Jurassic World movie. Mostly because it had so much potential in terms of visual effects. Those are awesome in this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Also, I loved the return of the old cast. The only thing they could've done better is the plot line. Somehow, it's not very eventful.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">What a pile of crop! I think this was the very first movie that made me almost fell asleep. The plot is a joke like it was written by 10 - year - olds yet somehow they thought if they crammed all the faces of the different movies together, it would make a good movie. Well they were mistaken. Badly. Typical milk cow Hollywood movie, do yourselves a favour and don't pay for this. Wait until it comes out! No, even then, don't watch it!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think expectations might play a part in perception of the film. For my part, I was expecting worse, because I'd heard the rumors of how the epidemic affected the filming, particularly regarding establishing shots. I'd also revised my expectations after seeing Fallen Kingdom, which was far dumber than this movie. Basically what this movie does is take the best one-liners and the best story elements from each film in the franchise, throw in a pinch of Baby and a dash of Fight the Future, put them in a blender and then blow it up on the big screen with a cast full of very pretty, very charismatic actors. Even the B listers filling out the supporting cast are pretty and charismatic (hello Dichen Lachman, it's been a hot minute but I've always got a minute for you). Scott Campbell is a villain you can love to hate as an amalgamation of real-life billionaires everybody's fumed about at least once. There are no beats in this story that you won't recognize, but there's always something fun to look at happening in the screen. For a heatwave summer full of depressing events, this was exactly the stupid movie I needed, even if it wasn't the one I initially thought I wanted.</div>

</div>
<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Last night I went to see ""Jurassic World 3 - A New Age"" at the cinema. Here's my personal impression of the movie.<br/><br/>Briefly to the starting position of the story (minimal spoilers)<br/><br/>The plot begins three years after the events of Jurassic World 2. Dinos have conquered the black market and have spread around the world in this way. This has turned life around the world upside down and both humans and animals must now live in coexistence with the new ""neighbor"", whether they like it or not. Of course, this again calls both poachers, hunters and conservationists on the plan, but of course also corporations who want to make their profit from it or who take advantage of the dinos to make medical advances with the help of their DNA. But as always, there is of course more to a large corporation than meets the eye. This then also calls Dr. Ellie Sattler on the scene, who analyzes a new life-threatening plague: gigantic locusts, which were obviously created artificially and are spreading further and further and eating up all the food. She enlists the help of Dr. Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm to uncover a mystery. Meanwhile, Owen Grady, Claire Dearing along with Maisie Lockwood live in a deserted area in a forest cabin to hide and protect Maisie because she is still wanted. Some dangerous people are after her. So much for the beginning and the starting point of the movie. (End of spoilers)<br/><br/>The story is of course both trashy and rather flat, the characters remain quite pale, but that's what the series is known for. So I don't blame the film for that at all. I watch such movies because they are supposed to entertain and not because of their profundity, complexity or heaviness.<br/><br/>Actors / Characters<br/><br/>Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is as likable as ever. I like his character and I like his manner. Pratt plays his role solidly as always. Pratt may be an actor who mostly plays himself and he's not as changeable now as a Leonardo DiCaprio, but he doesn't have to be. We also loved Arnie or Willis not because of their acting talent, but because of their style and their very own character. It's the same with Tom Cruise or Dwayne Johnson. And so it is with Chris Pratt. Owen Grady may be a flat and one-dimensional character, but such characters are also allowed (even must exist) in such trashy movies. Grady is simply the savior of the need, the helper who is always there when he is needed most.<br/><br/>Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is also as likable as ever. She is the animal/dinosaur protector par excellence and wants to prevent injustice to them at all costs. I buy this one. Otherwise, her character remains pale and superficial as well.<br/><br/>Then there is Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), the artificially created ""clone"" of Charlotte Lockwood. She is quite possibly the most complex character in the film and you learn more and more about her and her creation as the plot progresses. This is interesting and exciting and adds to my interest in the plot. The fact that there are then dangerous people after her raises even more questions than it provides answers. Isabelle Sermon plays this role wonderfully believably and I really like this character. If more films are made at some point, I think she should take the lead role.<br/><br/>Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is still the old and level-headed woman who questions many things and who takes a central role in the plot. Laura Dern still plays her character confidently and believably.<br/><br/>Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) assists Dr. Sattler in her investigation and is still the stubborn maverick. He and Sattler have great chemistry and you can tell they got along well on set as well. Sam Neill also still plays his character very believably and I always enjoy seeing him as an actor.<br/><br/>Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is of course also back in the cast and is once again allowed to utter wonderfully wacky, profound and philosophical phrases. He's still a great character with his wacky manner and charisma. I like him. And his scenes are always great and contrast with the serious situation.<br/><br/>Seeing all three of the old characters together again, and even as leads, is really pure nostalgia and was also sensibly integrated into the plot.<br/><br/>The antagonists are again just pull-off characters, but that's only half bad, because they serve their purpose to advance the plot and give the protagonists a task.<br/><br/>Then there's a new addition: Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise). She is a pilot and smuggler/mercenary. Her character is quite pale, but also sympathetic. She's a bit like the female Han Solo in Jurassic World.<br/><br/>Also nice to have Omar Sy alias Barry Sembène back, who now works for the CIA.<br/><br/>Dinos / CGI Animations / Action Scenes<br/><br/>Dinos are common in this finale and and appear in a wide variety of species.<br/><br/>The CGI animations are very well done in my eyes and the dinos mostly look very believable and move really great. The integration into the moving image is very well done, so that only rarely the feeling of a ""foreign body"" arises.<br/><br/>Really great class is the much higher creepiness and thrill factor in this finale of the trilogy. In the second half of the film, the characters come up against dangerous and deadly dinosaurs time and again and have to hide from them, sneak past them, run away or face them. This makes for an enormous amount of thrills and suspense.<br/><br/>The first half of the film, on the other hand, is more dialogue-heavy, serving more to build the plot and show the new world. But to lighten things up, there are one or two fast-paced action scenes here as well. There is also a motorcycle chase with raptors through a city. I especially liked that one because it was so well edited, staged and filmed, and it's also just exciting and entertaining.<br/><br/>I also love how the new world where humans and dinos coexist was depicted and staged. Playing children being harassed by Compsognathus dinosaurs, sauropods interfering with agriculture or other dinos showing up everywhere or even attacking and eating humans at times. I really liked this depiction of the new coexistence.<br/><br/>Camera / Scenery / Editing<br/><br/>As briefly mentioned, I really like the camera work and there are a lot of great shots and takes. There isn't constant shaky cam, but the scenes were captured well and you always keep a good view of what is happening. Creepy moments were also captured great. I also liked the editing. Not too many hard and fast cuts, but often quite long cuts at a stretch.<br/><br/>Music<br/><br/>As always, the music consists of both old and new pieces. However, I was so captivated by the film that I didn't notice the music that much. I would therefore not classify it as particularly positive or negative at the moment after my first viewing.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Jurassic World - A New Age is in my eyes a successful finale, which offers a lot of variety. The big appearance of the old guard from JP1 is a feast for nostalgics, especially since all three of them have a supporting role in the film and are present throughout from beginning to end. But Owen Grady and Claire Dearing also continue to be the likable characters I've known and taken to heart since JW1. Maisie Lockwood is the most exciting character and offers potential for a new lead in future films, if there will be any. The action scenes are classy and variedly staged and it never gets boring. There are a lot of dinosaur species in the film, and there are also a lot of thrills and plenty of scary and thrilling moments that took my breath away. Suspense is guaranteed here, especially in the second half of the film. The CGI effects are great and the dinos look very good.<br/><br/>Overall, I am highly satisfied with the conclusion of the series and was able to leave with a satisfied grin. Even after a night of sleep I am still very convinced of the film and look forward to the second viewing.<br/><br/>9/10 points - High rewatch value.</div>

This follows most of the sequels and reboots of the last few years (I'm looking at you The Matrix: Resurrections) with no real after-story to tell. Seeing the old and new cast together was nostalgic, but nothing else of value happened aside from several other actors of color added and no closure on what happened with Owen's friend Barry and Soyona who had minimal scenes.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World: Dominion is a messy, but fun movie. Seeing the old and new cast and characters interact was just awesome, but the many plotpoints get overwhelming at times, and make it hard to follow along with the story. The dinosaurs don't really get the spotlight, as the movie has a Political Theme going on with life living with the Dinosaurs. The size and scope is the biggest we've ever gotten from a Jurassic Movie, spanning to different continents and locations, which makes for some fun scenes with Dinosaur Chases and Dinosaur. Overall, not what I had in mind to be the epic conclusion to the saga, but still enjoyable. So, as the tagline for this review I have to call it fun but really flawed. It didn't bore me in any way, and I was still able to enjoy the movie and have fun with it.. but it had a HECK TON of Problems.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie has many nice shots and good cgi. Lots of action, sadly the action is rather dull and unoriginal, no scare potentiale. A good cast, but very weak and mangleded story.<br/><br/>In essence I felt that it was mostly soulless.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm not going to pile on to the poor rating, because frankly, it's no worse than ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and that sad sack flick got accolades from the public. Most likely because they're afraid to tell their friends the movie is horrific. Same here. The dominos fall where they must.<br/><br/>Universal logo meant a few things post 1993. Dinosaurs and theme parks. They invested so much into this franchise, some would say they invented the tie-in theme ride. First to have a world renown trolley tour of their backlot. Universal meant ""wonder"" When you paired this up with Steven Spielberg, they could print money. That was the case with the first of this trilogy. ""Jurassic World"" made so much money, it was a no-brainer more were in the works. And more will most likely be made next.<br/><br/>I am exhausted thinking about that.<br/><br/>Because dinosaurs are lame. Cool for kids, I guess. But the nostalgia I had for ""Jurassic Park"" ended when I grew up and realized how lumbering and dumb dinosaurs were. I wasn't even all that young when THAT came out. Here we have the introduction of a world...yes...and actual Jurassic World where man and dinosaurs co-exist. A terrible concept to begin with. You spend the entire movie wondering how we function like this. It's bad enough watching stupid people who can't curb their dogs in the city. OR they could be put into service by gulping down homeless people. Ouch. Any way, some evil doer in the world has created a dino-locust? That which is controllable and put into service to destroy food supplies. For what reason? Who knows? BUT, kinda interesting IF you consider this man wants us all extinct. Or at least a large swath of the population. Hopefully it's people who can't tell the difference between a man and a woman. Kinda plays up here. Since dinosaurs, in this world, can procreate without a mate (like some lizards). Wait, are the powers that be admitting we are lizards? Perhaps. And, in the case of the movie, arguable that we deserve to be extinct. The villain, for those who care, is from ""Jurassic Park"" He is Dodgson. The smarmy guy who meets up with Wayne Knight's character in the first movie. Dude who had the shaving cream can.<br/><br/>Okay, there's that plot. But then there is Ellie and Alan's love story. I guess. They didn't have much chemistry back in 1993, they have zippo 2022. It is labored and tired. And though I'm sure Laura Dern is a nice person, she has lost a ton of her warmness. It reminds us the age of where they're at. And it's painful. To watch over middle-agers do stunts they clearly didn't perform is depressing. Meanwhile, the saving grace is Jeff Goldblum's off-the-cuff remarks that remind us what movie we're in. He is, as he was in 1993, the joy of the movie. His delivery of lines is pitch perfect, though winks at the audience. Since we wait for his next quip.<br/><br/>There's that plot. But then...Owen Grady and Claire. Now living like Doomsday preppers. They essentially kidnap a clone kid - Maisie - who we last saw in ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" (I walked out of that dreadful movie by the way). She feels suffocated by her living arrangement, as most kidnapped kids should feel. But under the guise of her safety.<br/><br/>So yeah, you get it...this movie is just too much movie attempting to cram into one movie. A series is better suited for so much fan service. And that sense of wonder is dead. Perhaps our society is too cynical to enjoy a mindless ride. It's hard to tell, since we are very far gone from Spielberg's point of view when it comes to sense of wonder. That died with ""Schindler's List"" and hasn't come back.<br/><br/>I will say this, IF you are having a bad day, or are stressed out and you want your brain to just tune out for a couple of hours. This tends to be the better choice then aforementioned ""Top Gun: Maverick"" It isn't a good movie, but it will give you a goose here and there when it comes to nostalgia. Director Colin Trevorrow is getting the brunt of Hollywood now. Having been booted from ""Star Wars"" to helm this may have re-wired his brain to play things safe. They can pay as much fan service as they want, one needs to be a fan to enjoy some of the easter eggs.<br/><br/>For me, I am dino-saured out.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">As the title suggests, this movie is absolutely awful.<br/><br/>The main plot follows human-modified locusts, it hardly has anything to do with Jurassic Park or World, it's just an excuse to bring back the previous cast and it's not even a good excuse. They're hardly the most logical people for the job, it's a joke.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie tries to focus on dinosaurs living with humans for like 10 minutes, then it's back to ""running away from big bads"" and nothing makes sense, dinos are not scary, no one is in danger, the previous movies are entirely forgotten, everyone's motivation is either absurd or fake, the characters don't evolve one bit throughout the movie and the kid clone is an afterthought at best.<br/><br/>Overall it can be considered gorgeous but it barely evolved in 30 years forcing us to wonder if it was really worth it to do an entire trilogy for... this? Spoiler: it wasn't.<br/><br/>I expected nothing from this movie and that's basically what I got; nothing. Old cast, random dino names and giant locusts, wonderful. What a waste of time.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I waited for years for this movie, and got disappointed. This is the first time ever I got bored, watching a big budget dinosaurs movie. It was like watching movie about JP characters, and the dinosaurs are the cameo. I hated watching dinosaurs that are too weaponized. They don't make sense, not fun to watch. I wouldnt believe you can engineer a dino to hunt a man you point a laser pointer to.<br/><br/>Next thing about this movie that is so cheesy, is that this movie is trying to depict ""Apple"" (yes, apple computer) as the company that is behind Biosyn. The boss really looks like Tim Cook (apple ceo), the clothing, and the office do really looks like Apple campus, all the work environment style, that the company has so many funding to it, etc.<br/><br/>Come on, aren't there any more creativity left in this world?</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">If you are a fan of dinosaurs fighting each other, this movie is for you. If you are a fan of suspenseful moments where dinosaurs are hunting humans and the humans are trying to escape death, boy, you're in for a real treat. I was in awe by the action scenes in this movie and how realistic the graphics of the dinosaurs were. The last section of the movie is packed with dinosaur fighting scenes, you'll love it. There were a few notable scenes, especially the ones with the baby raptor dinosaur, where it looked TOO fake with too much CGI because it didn't blend well with the forest background. It didn't detract too much from the immersion of the movie but it was definitely noticeable.<br/><br/>The story was decent. It does a decent job of recapping the previous movie story a little bit. You will greatly benefit if you remember what happened in the earlier movies because they pretty much get into the story and continue it. The relationship between the characters will make much more sense if you remember what they did in the past. I didn't like how the movie just drops newly introduced characters. Especially in the first half, there are times where they introduce a new actor and then the story changes locations and you never see that actor again. They introduce dinosaurs that react to lazer pointers but you never see them again after that.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the middle part since it drags on a little bit. The part where people are sneaking into the lab and there's heavy dialog wasn't presented interesting enough to me..<br/><br/>The acting is superb from all the actors. The way they acted terrified from these fake CGI dinosaurs were very believable. Jeff Goldblum was funny and talked eloquently as he always does. The audience at my movie theatre laughed at some of his dialog. I didn't see the other jurassic park movies from the 90's with the original actors. But i still felt like i this was going to be epic when the original actors and the new actors from the jurassic world story arc joined together.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of the villain, he was evil but his motivation other than greed money was kinda shallow. He was also kind of weak, depending totally on his workers to just blindly follow him.<br/><br/>All in all, come for the action and suspense. You'll appreciate this movie so much more if you remember the previous movies and if you know the actors from their other movies.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Jurassic World culminates its story with a rather dull note. Especially considering the promise of great momentum that they had worked so hard to build earlier. Basically, it's just a rehash of the franchise's tired formula instead of branching it into something more different and exuberantly daring.<br/><br/>The presence of the legacy characters deserved the joyful welcome despite the fact that they didn't really make the necessary splash to excite the story. They graced the screen only for the nostalgia and some fan service.<br/><br/>Therefore, Jurassic World Dominion's sole reason to exist apparently is for the audiences to enjoy the thrilling dinosaurs' action.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Most of us who grew up with the original JP were captivated by the film in many different ways. Some people loved the grandeur of such creatures, some loved the thrill of a summer blockbuster done right and the rest loved both those aspects.<br/><br/>That movie has been loved by us for decades now, so I'm not going to compare the latest installment to it. That's unfair given the nature of the present day audience, who are kids just like we were but with way more pretentious ideologies and social media influenced interests.<br/><br/>(I myself avoided such a fate, given that social media in general started shaping the younger generation right after I took on more adult responsibilities in life)<br/><br/>Now, let's get into it.<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion is by no means a bad movie.<br/><br/>Given what we went through in the last one(which isn't the directors fault, he did his job right), you would think that this doesn't deserve the hate it's getting.<br/><br/>However, the strangest thing about this movie is that whatever makes it worth watching is also the stuff that quickly ruins it.<br/><br/>If you're going to make a dinosaur movie, then make a dinosaur movie.<br/><br/>Instead what we get is an erratic attempt at merging this concept with those from the fast and furious/mission impossible movies and trying to force the same old pandering we've seen one too many times.<br/><br/>And like I mentioned, that's pretty much what makes this entertaining enough to sit through but also leaves you dissatisfied at the end of it.<br/><br/>We're here to watch Jurassic World, not the Avengers.<br/><br/>I will say that the film starts off very strong, and does make me care about the little girl from the last movie. Her storyline was surprisingly inspiring, and could have paved the way for a much better plot overall.<br/><br/>Past the halfway mark however, it quickly becomes a mess of rushed plot lines all trying to close off the story as a whole and you are left with a feeling of emptiness when the credits roll.<br/><br/>Another glaring issue was that whatever the trailer was advertising as the plot, is almost non existent in this movie. Even the scene of the T-rex ""attacking"" a movie theatre is simply for the online marketing.<br/><br/>There is hardly any real threat faced by the human race, which does make sense to be honest but it's not in keeping with what the last movie did right by setting up.<br/><br/>I was ready to hate this movie just for its diversion from the source material and the original trilogy. I instead dislike it for trying too hard to match up to said material, but without any sense of purpose or care.<br/><br/>The lines are cheesy, the acting is semi decent but not inspired, the dinosaurs are almost forgotten in a movie called Jurassic World that took two movies to setup, but are also pushed into every minute of screen-time.<br/><br/>It feels like a poorly constructed ride with characters that are written even worse and have the most cliché motivations.<br/><br/>All in all, I would suggest watching this movie at-least once on a big screen with a nice bag of popcorn to go with it. It will not be what you want, but is a good enough experience that you will not want to leave halfway.<br/><br/>The old cast appearing in the film didn't seem forced in my book, just a huge coincidence that they would all be together as the film went on.<br/><br/>There is no real way that they should meet(old and new cast), but they do!<br/><br/>That's just bad editing, which there seems to be a lot of during it's 2 hour 30 minute runtime. There was no reason for it to be this long, but it is.<br/><br/>I rate it 5/10.<br/><br/>If they ever make a new series of movies, I would like them to be their own thing, and an extension of the original trilogy as opposed to this weird attempt at showcasing the dangers of genetic power.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first one is still by far the best story of them all, and this one has a story I wasn't particularly interested in, but I'd feel like a total heal to rate this any lower than a 7 due to the effort that went into creating the incredible special effects. If it wasn't for those, this would basically put you to sleep, and I did find myself nodding off during one of the few moments lacking much action. But go into this to admire the artistry in the movie making itself, and I think you'll enjoy the experience. That said, I sure hope they don't make another one, because there is no more story to tell, and they've reached the peak on dinosaur action.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Typical storyline of jurassic world. Vfx are also not amazing. But superb mind blowing audio work with the superb clarity of dolby atmos mixing. But still the first jurassic park movie is better than this. The dinosaurs are very realistic though it was 1993. This is not up to the level but nice and treat to watch. Definitely watch in a theatre. Otherwise useless.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">SCORE: 9.7/10<br/><br/>Such a roller coaster ride. Admittedly, the movie did start out a bit slow, but once it picked up the pace I couldn't think anything else but how this was the perfect swan song to Jurassic Park. It took the old and the new, gave them separate storylines and then brought them together, which gave birth to some of the best moments of the entire film.<br/><br/>With each Jurassic World movie, Claire and Owen's chemistry was improved. This was their peak. They are full on parents to Maisie and they still had that element of mystery to their relationship that really sets them apart from a lot of on-screen couples. This was Bryce Dallas Howard's best Jurassic acting performance by far. Although her performance was amazing, the rest of the cast also had awesome performances that made it very well balanced and easy to like all the characters. Jeff Goldblum is an absolute gem and his banter was top tier. Once again, this movie picked some really good supporting characters and the incorporation of Dr. Henry Wu was epic.<br/><br/>This film had such stunning visuals and audio and some of it was truly terrifying. The final battle between the Giganotosaurus and T-Rex was goated and Jurassic World: Dominion was the perfect title for this movie. Fallen Kingdom set up the idea that the Dinosaurs were beginning to take over and this movie solidified that they had true dominion over the human species.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">We loved it. We were so looking forward to its cinema release and we were not disappointed. Next day on our wild walk, it was interesting to discuss the film &amp; amazing how a group of people can all watch the same film and see and understand scenes differently. The cast were brilliant, nail biting bits brilliant, Dinosaurs put on a good show. We can't wait to see it again (this time on a normal cinema screen) &amp; then to watch it in a marathon with the other 5 films. I recommend it, escapism with bite!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Much better than anticipated with all the criticism. I wouldn't say it's too long; they crammed a lot into 2 and half hours, it only felt long for the first 50min because it wasn't until then that any actual action occurred. We do get to see plenty of dinosaurs in that time, though, a lot in fact, as they had accumulated across the world and been processed/handled appropriately by the government. This they did really well on writing and execution. The whole Maisie situation was eyeroll heavy but not as bad as Fallen Kingdom in my opinion. Some of my biggest gripes were dinosaur behavior (a herbivore killing deer and challenging apex predators), characters not using their guns during standoffs with raptors, and the inaccurate design of the Giga. But hey, all in good fun, right? The action was abundant, even if the characters were invincible, Grant and Sattler had a lot of screentime, Malcolm too, Pratt was great and my favorite, Claire, possibly had all of the best scenes. New raptor designs were immensely appreciated, I just wish they had been involved in more than a predictable chase scene. The amount of animatronics and practical effects were shocking, I give major props to that; the dimetrodon sequence was amazing! Sure, the flick has its flaws and hiccups, but what JW doesn't? It felt like a sound conclusion to the series to me, though I still yearn for more.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This And The Lost World would have to be the two worst in the series . The film is far too long at 2.5 hours . Why do they have to make films so long ? It gets boring. The film has too many storylines. It started well and had some good action scenes early on .I'm glad the series is ending after this disappointment.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World Dominion, unlike many other sequels in this saga, accomplishes what it set out to do. For casual viewers it has enough action, moments of wonder -that seemed to be missing in this franchise for the longest time- and enough plain fun. For the fans of the Jurassic movies it's a nostalgic joyride from start to finish.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>+ It's 6th movie in a franchise that manages not to feel dull and dumb.<br/><br/>+ Gone are the stupid moments of dinosaurs swallowing ringing cell phones, escape from dinosaur on high heels or dinosaurs smiling.<br/><br/>+ The plot, unlike in many of it's predecessors, actually makes more sense from scientific standpoint. It's still an action sci-fi horror monster movie, but it is consistent to the saga's mythos and characters.<br/><br/>+ Features more dinosaurs than all of the other movies combined, and the new ones are different and exciting.<br/><br/>+ The different locations of this movie from the previous tropical islands makes it stand out visually.<br/><br/>+ Fixes some of the plot holes of the saga, explains some character motivations and quickly resolves idiotic plotlines from the previous movie.<br/><br/>+ The script is very tight, I was amazed how they managed to fit everything into the runtime. Ending is not overdone like in the previous four movies and it is more impactful.<br/><br/>+ Stupid dialogue is pretty much gone, caricatures of human beings are not present. Some characters are fixed to be much better this time around. Some dialogue is surprisingly great. Fun jokes.<br/><br/>+ Some brilliant camerawork throughout, great effects, brilliant visuals.<br/><br/>+ The story weaves it's many protagonists through the plot and puts them all together for the grand finale in a believable way.<br/><br/>+ Great star power, the original cast elevates this movie and it's just a mystery to me why it took 29 years to put them in a movie together again.<br/><br/>+ Brains and fan moments throughout the movie that many of the sequels lacked.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>The movie has very little time to breathe, I would appreciate a 15 minute longer version with more character development and dialogue.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cut suffers sometimes from the same issue as the last two movies, it is in some scenes way too abrupt.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When the score doesn't play John Williams themes, it's mostly only above average.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Missed opportunities for some side characters.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The opening montage to catch up on the plot of previous movies is poorly done. It throws so much information on you and serves very little purpose other than exposition. It starts out like a B movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>I don't think anybody expected a genre defying experience like Jurassic Park brought in 1993. It definitely shows though that some of the ideas from the original are brought up here: Cloning, impact on humanity, mixing of species. While every other sequel after that mainly served to be a fun summer blockbuster, this movie surprised me in delving slightly back into these ideas from the original. Since then, there always was some dumb moment in each of the sequels that made me cringe: The entire San Diego sequence from the second movie, the terrible second half of the third movie, the stupidity of the fourth movie that among other things suggested dinosaurs have human-like IQ and the entire fifth movie, that seems mostly like a parody. Jurassic World Dominion is fun, almost entirely absent of these moments and has enough for you to enjoy it, especially if you are a fan of the original. 8/10.</div>

It was a beautifully shot movie with a very intricate and powerful story that perfectly combined both sets of cast members. I'm at a loss when reading the bad reviews as I feel like everyone in the theater agreed with us and was cheering along. Who are these haters?? Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed and go with friends and family, it's even more fun!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I wasn't a huge fan of the previous Jurassic World movies, but when I saw the trailer I was actually really excited to see the original cast again, and I decided to go see this with an open mind. Yes it was great to see the original cast get back together and there were some laughs here and there, but this definitely fell flat of my expectations. I could see where they were trying to go with how advanced the science and genetics had become, but for a final chapter, such a disappointment. I wouldn't recommend spending the money to see it in theaters, and seeing it in 3D didn't add anything special.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not what i expected, there were a lot of ideas crammed into this finale of this Jurassic saga which spanned over 30yrs. As much as I loved seeing the old team from the original trilogy in this movie, I feel as though it was rushed throwing them into this film.<br/><br/>Putting in the Therizinosaurus and Giganotosaurus wasn't enough, I expected a salvage expedition in retrieving the dinosaurs that were sold in the Fallen Kingdom, that wasn't what I seen, what I seen was ""rinse and repeat"" story, dinosaur gets kidnapped and a team get involved to save the day and a lot of near-miss dino meals.<br/><br/>This movie should've gone out with a bang, it fell way below the expectation of a lot of fans out there. The reason there is 6/10 is I love seeing dinosaurs in movies and the fact that the T-Rex always wins.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't like it. It seemed very far fetched and not even what I thought it would be. I honestly liked the park movies more when they tried splicing dinosaurs. This movie wasn't that good. I wouldn't watch it again even though I really, really love dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Jurassic Dominion starts with the timeline being four years passed since Fallen Kingdom. There is no explanation on how there exists an insanely huge amount of dinosaurs more than those that escaped from the Lockwood mansion on the mainland. The raptor Blue was given some super speculative explanation as to having some dna of a lizard that can reproduce on its own in times of no other available mates. That's a slight chance of possibility of occurrence.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs are being bought and sold on the black market, and still, they went with the very stupid idea that a laser target will induce a carnivorous dinosaur to attack said target. Any time you can point a laser at someone, you can also point a gun.<br/><br/>The dinosaur fights weren't all that interesting. It wasn't very good. At one point, Claire was outrunning a dinosaur that was chasing her in Malta, but as soon as she ended up in a vehicle, the dinosaur was right behind the car. I mean, Claire must be running at like, 80mph to outrun the dinosaur.<br/><br/>The clone girl, Maisie, is a clone but also the genius and illegal experiment of Lockwood's brainiac daughter, Charlotte, who created Maisie because she wanted children...it doesn't even make sense. Adopt a child. Fall in love with a suitable boyfriend or husband to have a child with. It makes absolutely no sense on how Charlotte didn't even know she had a genetic disease that killed her, yet cloned Maisie and was able to alter Maisie's dna to eradicate the genetic anomaly.<br/><br/>Nothing came from the buyers at Lockwood mansion who bought dinosaur eggs who survived. There's no story following those dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The scientist all of a sudden having a conscience without no path on how he changed is very much holding no sympathy from me. There's no progress in his character. He went from ""guy who placed money above all else"" to ""guy who wants to save the world for free"". It's a total 180 that I doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>All the new dinosaurs literally came from nowhere. Biosyn, which is supposed to be the company that stole the dinosaur eggs in Jurassic Park, had Dino eggs for like, two decades and did NOTHING with those eggs until now? It makes no sense. Also, the guy they had to steal the dinosaur eggs got killed and dropped the container holding the eggs where it was covered with mud and assumed to be lost. Where are the new dinosaurs coming from?<br/><br/>Also, apex predators in the same habitat and not a single one was harmed? You have the t-Rex, the allosaurus, and the therizinosauraus. One didn't kill the other? And why is the therizinosauraus blind? It obviously didn't see Claire which gave her enough time to crawl into the water.<br/><br/>I love Chris Pratt, especially in The Tomorrow War, but his character literally wasn't that interesting in this one.<br/><br/>It was nostalgic seeing the older cast, but the reason why they were in the movie is pretty dumb. You'd think they'd come back to rid the world of dinosaurs but nope. Just some giant locusts. That's why. Also, wouldn't they be retired by now and living the rest of their lives being happy? Also, haven't they learned already that they don't want to deal with dinosaurs since the last few movies?<br/><br/>And since when do guns, missiles, and nukes not kill dinosaurs? The world has pretty powerful weapons. I mean, if a dinosaur can withstand a missile, the military application wouldn't be to use the creature to kill people. The application should be taking that dinosaur skin and making amazing bullet proof body armor from it.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my take on why I don't like the movie and won't watch it again.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World: Dominion opened in theaters this weekend. It is the highly anticipated sixth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise. In Dominion, we find out whether the dinosaurs, who were released into the world at the end of Fallen Kingdom, have been integrated into the greater society and what effect their presence has on the broader ecosystem. It's been almost 30 years since we were first introduced to dinosaurs in modern times; but, six films later, are we still in awe of the scientific feats of DNA splicing and cloning? Here's whether going back to Jurassic World is worth all of that anticipation.<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion brings back Owen Grady (Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Howard), who are raising the teenage clone, Maisie Lockwood (Sermon). They are protecting her from evil corporate interests who seek to capture and study her for their own nefarious reasons. Also, Elli Sattler (Dern) and Alan Grant (Neill) are back to investigate a potential ecological disaster brought on by genetically modified locusts rabidly devouring the world's crops. Then, there is Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) and Ramsay Cole (Athie) as fixtures of the corporation, Biosyn, which is at the center of all of these machinations. There's also a dynamic pilot, Kayla Watts (Wise), and a manipulative CEO of Biosyn, Lewis Dodgson (Scott). Oh man, did I forget anything? Um... prehistoric ravenous hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>Okay, as you can see, there is a lot going on in Jurassic World: Dominion. It's not necessarily complicated, but it is a lot to follow. These Jurassic Park movies always have a bit of an issue getting bogged down explaining the science of this all. In Dominion, they have to talk about genetic splicing and cloning and ecology, and it just goes on and on. Sattler and Grant are focused on stealing the DNA of these destructive locusts to prove that Biosyn is evil. Owen and Claire are focused on protecting Maisie from Biosyn. In a sense, it feels like so much is going on that there is not enough time for the characters to run and scream from the dinosaurs. That's the unfortunate part if you really like that aspect from the original.<br/><br/>Despite these reservations of the plot, the movie does have its exciting parts. There are dinosaur chases through the streets, through the jungle and through the Biosyn facilities. DeWanda Wise plays a tough-as-nails, wisecracking pilot, who seems to be the most competent of all of our characters. She gets good one-liners and has a magnetic personality. Her presence adds a lot of energy to what could become stale. I'll also note that the legacy characters of Sattler, Grant and Malcolm give exactly what you want. It's like no time has passed at all. The nostalgia is very high and they effectively scratch that Jurassic Park itch.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Jurassic World: Dominion is an enjoyable, escapist summer blockbuster. The problem here is that there is too much going on and it doesn't exactly all come together. There are probably too many characters that distract from the main attraction - the dinosaurs. Nevertheless, there are good dinosaur chases and exciting moments with a great new character played by DeWanda Wise. While I wouldn't call Jurassic World: Dominion essential, it certainly is good enough for a matinee viewing, so get your bowl of popcorn.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Allegedly this is going to be the last one - well that is probably true ... until the next one comes out. And by that I mean the next trilogy. Maybe this time around they will do a reboot - stop laughing. Although I guess that pun is worth at least a chuckle.<br/><br/>Now for those who have not seen a Jurassic Park/World movie ... I am not sure, you want to start with this movie right here to be honest. It does make sense to at least watch the first Park and World movies. Just so you understand why the linger on some shots - or why you should go wow or aw at certain moments.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is filled with amazing visual moments. And while I credit this for not being the first movie with slight changes ... it isn't too different from it either. The trailer and the buzz did suggest that this time this would go worldwide. But apart from one action scene outside the Park/World - we again go back mostly to the enclosed space where most of the dinosaurs are being held.<br/><br/>We do have the uber-villain once again. Those rich people who can't get enough ... money? But he says it isn't about money ... what is it about then? You better not start with questions is my advice. Whether it is about motive or about logic (characters being superheroes and not feeling pain - though you have that in other movies too) or the story ... just enjoy the madness. And some interesting moments. Most of best ones coming from something Jeff Goldblum delivers - not sure if those were all written in the script or he improvised ... but they do work.<br/><br/>That being said, we should not expect much more from this franchise. Now lay them to rest - please.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've heard that a lot of people didn't like this film and I'm curious to understand why. In my opinion, it's an improvement over fallen kingdom and a great conclusion to the franchise. The first half of the film is almost great but it gets better and better as the movie goes on. My favorite dinosaur is Blue the velociraptor and her little baby raptor as well. This movie is overhated.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a total piece of crap. The only good parts were when the 3 characters from the original trilogy were on screen. The set pieces were Jurassic Bourne or Jurassic Bond except more bloated. Everytime the overrated Chris Pratt was on screen I was rooting for the dinosaurs. I want my 2 1/2 hours vack.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World was a great reboot of the franchise ignited by Jurassic Park, the second film, Forbidden Kingdom, was alright, I heard negative things about the third in the trilogy, but I was prepared to see it and judge it for myself. Basically, four years after the volcanic eruption on Isla Nublar and the breakout of the dinosaurs at the Lockwood Estate incident who are freely roaming across the earth. Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), former operations manager of Jurassic World, is still working for the Dinosaur Protection Group. She and former Jurassic World ethologist Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) are in a relationship and living in the Sierra Nevada mountains in a remote cabin, secretly raising teenage Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), Benjamin Lockwood's cloned granddaughter. One day, Blue, the Velociraptor that Owen trained, unexpectedly arrives at the cabin with an asexually reproduced offspring which Maisie names Beta. Biosyn Genetics, a rival company of InGen, is conducting research on dinosaurs genes, hoping for medical and agricultural breakthroughs to global issues. Biosyn wants to study Maisie's DNA for their research, Owen and Claire warn her not to go out. But Maisie is frustrated with living in seclusion, and has been sneaking away, and is soon spotted and kidnapped, along with Beta, by Biosyn operatives. Elsewhere, evolved giant locusts have appeared in huge swarms and are threatening the global food supply. Paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is suspicious that Biosyn created the locusts, observing that crops grown by the company have been left uneaten. Believing the locust's DNA dates to the Cretaceous period, Ellie approaches former partner and paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), who agrees to help investigate Biosyn. With assistance from CIA contacts, Claire and Owen track Maisie and Beta to Malta. There, dinosaurs are on the black market, and when the market is raided by authorities, dinosaurs are unintentionally released, causing havoc. Claire and Owen find out from a Biosyn employee that Maisie and Beta are being transported to Biosyn's secluded headquarters in the Dolomite Mountains in Italy. Former Air Force and cargo pilot Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise) wants to help Owen and Claire and offers to fly them to facility. Meanwhile, Alan and Ellie have been invited to Biosyn by their friend, chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), now working with them, and they are introduced to Biosyn CEO Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) (previously seen with Dennis Nedry in Jurassic Park). Ian is secretly working to uncover Dodgson's illegal activities, with communications director Ramsay Cole (Mamoudou Athie) aiding him. Lead geneticist Dr. Henry Wu (B. D. Wong), the scientist behind the dinosaur cloning programs at Jurassic Park and Jurassic World, genetically engineered the locusts and crops with Biosyn seed to dominate the agricultural market. Wu meets Maisie and explains that she is not a clone, she is in fact the asexually conceived daughter of Charlotte Lockwood (Isabella Sermon and Elva Trill). Charlotte died from a genetic disorder, but she had altered Maisie's DNA to make her immune. Wu believes that Maisie's and Beta's DNA are key to creating a pathogen to halt the locust outbreak. Approaching Biosyn, Kayla's cargo plane is attacked by a group of Quetzalcoatlus. Claire ejects while Owen and Kayla survive a crash landing. After encountering a Therizinosaurus and a Pyroraptor, the three regroup. Inside Biosyn, Ian gives Ellie an access card, she and Alan access a restricted lab where they steal a locust sample and find Maisie. Discovering the locust lab was breached, Dodgson destroys all evidence of the experiment by igniting the lab, inadvertently starting a fire that spreads to Biosyn's outer dinosaur valley. He also fires Ian for exposing his operation. After Alan, Ellie, and Maisie find Ian, they meet up with Owen, Claire, and Kayla. Meanwhile, Dodgson tries to escape with dinosaur embryos, but the power fails, he is trapped and subsequently killed by three Dilophosaurus. Electronic implants summon the dinosaurs to the Biosyn headquarters to protect them from the fire, while Owen rescues Beta. A Giganotosaurus terrorises the group until the Therizinosaurus and the Tyrannosaurus Rex kill it. The group escapes in a helicopter, taking Wu with them. Once back on the mainland, Wu successfully neutralises the locusts by releasing one carrying a pathogen he discovered. After joining Ian and Ramsay in testifying against Biosyn, Ellie and Alan rekindle their relationship. Owen, Claire, and Maisie return home and reunite Beta and Blue. Around the world, dinosaurs adapt to co-existing with modern animals while Biosyn Valley is declared a dinosaur sanctuary by the United Nations. Also starring Omar Sy as Barry Sembène, Justice Smith as Franklin Webb, Daniella Pineda as Dr. Zia Rodriguez, Scott Haze as Rainn Delacourt, and Dichen Lachman as Soyona Santos. It is good to bring together Dern, Neill and Goldblum from the Jurassic Park trilogy, and Pratt and Dallas Howard from the Jurassic World trilogy, all give performances as good as you'd expect, but as before, the dinosaurs more often steal the show. What made the original Jurassic Park great was the sense of wonder with fantastic CGI bringing dinosaurs to life, the first Jurassic World did recapture some of the magic, but as with the second instalment of this trilogy, the story and writing is hardly prioritised. The plot is almost non-sensical, the globe-trotting element is slightly pointless, and although some of the chases and thrills do get your attention, it feels predictable and obviously style over substance, but it's not a terrible science-fiction action. Okay!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I think you can enjoy the movie....<br/><br/>... but for me... I left the cinema felt disappointed. Watching the trailer even the short film Battle at Big Rock... I was hoping finally we gonna see the actual Jurrasic World where an environmental ecological and geopolitical issues arise when humans and dinosaurs cannot coexist ala Planet of The Apes.<br/><br/>Instead what we got is the same old thing... a corporate intervention and manipulation on dinosaurs in an Island... yet again!<br/><br/>The 3rd act eventhough have some actions... it's a repeat to every Jurassic Park movies... it's so familiar it become a snooze fest to me... in fact... I just go out from the cinema hall and take a leak... which I never did that in so many years... went back in and did not feel I missed anything.<br/><br/>Feeling disappointed... 4.5/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I never get tired of the Jurassic Movies. Yes, the very first one was off the charts Entertaining ! - Incredible ! - This one has a lot more action and suspense but I enjoyed it very much. I think the issue we all may have is it is compared to the other Jurassic movies and well, that is the rub for the lower reviews. Sad but True.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Other than the (completely over-the-top) action scenes this movie was on par with a root canal treatment without the pain killers as the plot and dialogue between characters was SO UNREALISTIC and FORCED.

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie felt like I was watching Roland Emmericks (2012, Day after Tomorrow) latest film. So much fake garbage in an already fiction movie. No sense of real danger of any of the characters. Too many throw backs to the first one. Almost every other scene felt like a reenactment of a scene from the first. Just very ""super hero-ish movie"" feel too it. Had some decent visuals. Overall I was just waiting for the end. :(. Makes me sad they did this to JP Universe.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I fell in love with the story of Jurassic Park when the central focus was on the dinosaurs. Now, woke Hollywood wants to push certain ideologies that take away from the magic and mystery of our childhood favorite blockbusters. These movies have always been made for a younger audience. What kid wants to learn about genetic modification and black markets exploiting dinosaurs? I can't be the only one who thinks that this movie could've done perfectly fine without a major character in there (Isabella). Seriously, in what way did she add something interesting to the storyline? She was a new character in the series and she was given the most importance because her mom cloned her into existence by genetically modifying her? That's creepy and weird as hell, and the fact that the movie makes it sound like a miracle and give her so much importance leaves me to wonder what kind of message is Hollywood trying to tell us? That screwing around with kid's DNA and genetically cloning them should be embraced in some manner? Dinosaurs are being experimented with and human kids should be too? Is this type of grooming necessary in a kid's movie? What exactly does this have to do with jurassic park?<br/><br/>These sequels and remakes just keep getting worse, and Hollywood is using nostalgia as bait to get us to watch these movies. It had some good scenes, the cgi and technology used is amazing and Hollywood does it best. But I can't seem to ignore that fact that many of these movies have subliminal messages behind the action and dialogue. I.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Go see Jurassic World: Dominion.<br/><br/>Go see it on the biggest screen you can find. It's epic in scope and scale. They took the feedback from the second movie and used so many more practical effects and animatronic dinosaurs. I clapped, I laughed, I choked up, I sat on the edge of my seat, I will see this again and again.<br/><br/>The first and second Jurassic Park movies were disaster/survival movies... Then they went dumb for three movies and made monster movies because they thought people would be tired of ""plain"" dinosaurs. Finally they realized no one has ever seen a dinosaur so how the hell are you going to be tired of them?! This is a great disaster/survival movie and I REALLY hope they make more.<br/><br/>For starters, we could use a high budget limited series about how they got Jurassic Park back under control for Jurassic World. Then you could just use Jurassic World as a back drop for any genre of movie :)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw the reviews before going to see this movie, so I had low expectations, but I gotta say, this movie isn't that bad, in fact it's pretty good. It's a TON of fun, and the original characters add some life to this movie that felt missing from the other Jurassic World films. The plot is the only thing that kind of doesn't work, but even so it's not bad, it's just passable. The action scenes are amazing, and the adventurous globetrotting feel of this movie makes it stand out from the others. The dinosaurs, of course, are awesome, and there are some touching scenes with them here. In the end, it's kind of the dinosaurs themselves that are the emotional center of this film. Best Jurassic movie since The Lost World.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a fan of the Jurassic Park Saga, this movie delivers. It was a great installment to the Jurassic World films. It truly hit the mark with reintroducing the original Cast and was definitely done right. If you are a Fan of the movies this is definitely one to see. There are a couple slow moments but definitely pays off in the end. Even though I did enjoy this movie and would recommend it to anyone, I just hope they end the Series here. The ending was Perfect and did not leave any open-ended questions and I think if they did try to continue the series it would just ruin it and would not really have a story to give. If you are looking for a movie that is action/adventure packed and safe for the whole family I would suggest going to see this film.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Gonna cut right to the chase and say die hard fans of the jurassic series will love this one, including myself. Compared to the first 2 jurassic world movies, this was an improvement. But by all means, this movie was good, but not great. I didn't enjoy jurassic world because it felt like a bad attempt at a remake of jurassic park. And don't get me started on fallen kingdom, I don't know how I sat through that movie when it was in theaters. It was just so awful, the worst jurassic movie of them all. So my expectations for this movie were pretty low. This is what the first jurassic world movie should have been. It reminded me of the rise of the planet of the apes series. But, If you're looking for a realistic interpretation of how dinosaurs would live among humans, this movie isn't for you. This movie is purely entertainment. If it were realistic the main characters would've been dead a long time ago. The action can be cheesy and predictable, but it's fun, and some of the action sequences had me ready to jump, something i haven't felt since the first jurassic park. This movie was definitely carried by the return of the original jurassic park cast, i would not have enjoyed it as much as i did if they weren't in it. This movie actually felt like it had somewhat of a plot. And somehow still doesn't feel like the end of the series. I would not be mad if they made another jurassic world movie, as long as they continue to expand the world of the story.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">No, this film isn't about ""dinosaurs rule the earth""! But it's better this way.<br/><br/>The actors are flawless, good job everyone!<br/><br/>The first half like a Bourne film, the second half is Biosyn Park.<br/><br/>The end not feels like a proper ending, but ok.<br/><br/>One star is down because there was 2-3 silly scene in it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie disappoints on every level, the trailer gave away all the action scenes and it doesn't feel like a sequel to the previous films. There are no memorable moments to speak of and even the dinosaurs when they are on screen which is barely ever do nothing special. Such a disappointment.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World Dominion: Dinosaurs everywhere, yeah they spread out after the escapes in the last film. Of course there's a black market, trading in the creatures. In some places there's a modus vivendi, wonderful to watch brontosauri proceeding stately, respected by loggers. But other outfits illegally trap, breed and export the dinosaurs. Clair Dearing is back combating these trappers, Owen Grady (on horseback) rounds up the animals to be transported to reserves. They both live in a remote cabin in the Sierra Nevada mountains with the cloned Maisie Lockwood. But Maisie is kidnapped along with the baby raptor Beta. A parallel story-line involves Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant trying to solve the riddle of what has caused a plague of giant locusts which is devouring crops and causing famine. They link up with Ian Malcolm. There's also the sinister BioSyn company which runs a dinosaur reserve in a temperate rain forest in the the Dolomite Mountains. The two narratives eventually merge in that valley.<br/><br/>Great scenes of battling dinosaurs but also TV News shows about the problems the creatures cause. Small flying dinosaurs devouring doves released at a wedding, a trawler being dragged under by a sea dinosaur. Planes are brought down by flocks of Quetzalcoatlus and a Giganotosaurus combats a T-Rex. The screenplay won't win an Oscar but there are frightening, amusing and thrilling scenes. Also some excellent scenes of raptors pursuing motorbikes and and chasing people across rooftops. My favourite scene was an escooter rider being plucked up and devoured! A chase movie, an action thriller and a conspiracy involving a Bond style villain. Just enjoy it! Directed by Colin Trevorrow, written by Trevorrow and Emily Carmichael. 7/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I managed to see all of the jurassic movies at the cinema and had my favourites. First Spielberg film was favourite and then the third one followed by the second. I found jurassic world part 1 enjoyable enough. Didn't really stretch the story but it was fine. Second was ok but lost its way around the midpoint and to the end. This new one I credit with attempting to find a new variant to the story but in the end, where can it really go? But back to the same tried and tested formula of the other five. After all, it is a dinosaur movie! The action was routine, story pretty basic and too many holes where you know it doesn't make sense that governments etc would not be aware etc. Effects were great but in the end this is a by the numbers plot and the cast are wasted with standard dialogue. I got bored at about the half way point and that stayed with me until the end. Not awful but not great either. Great effects wasted on an uninspired script.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I actually love seeing my childhood heroes back on the big screen for the last movie of this ""Jurassic World"" Trilogy. But my love for them is shadowed by a movie with a lot of loopholes and some parts are either too rushed or too long. I remember when I watch the first Jurassic Park movie and I tremble in fear when the tyrannosaurus Rex came out. But now, I can only see dinosaurs for like 5 minutes of the movie and the rest is just them explaining the plot of the movie and the drama.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I always enjoy Jurassic Park movies, but this one was just so fluffy? Waste of money to make? Terrible acting? I like the pilot actress(cant remember her name), she was really good. Bryce Dallas Howard is so bad all the time, I guess the others were passable but Disney has a formula, and this one is just a Disney movie. I liked it, but it could have been so much more. They just need to stop making these movies especially if Dallas Howard is in them.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I love the Jurassic park / World Series. I did not have high expectations coming into this movie having read reviews but didn't realise how bad it actually was going to be . Children will love this movie because there are scenes where dinosaurs are fighting each other and well being dinosaurs which kids love but unfortunately the storyline simply just sucks. It feels like a fast and furious movie where they have strayed away from what people love . The main storyline is not even about dinosaurs no more .</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The only fun thing about the movie is to see the old characters get together. Other than that the story was predictable and down right boring. Worse than the other movies. I fell asleep during the movie. That's how entertained I was.......</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This film has a single message, gender identity. As they are doing in Star Wars, they used this film to show that dinosaurs, animals and humans can live together.<br/><br/>As if humans weren't responsible for the extinction of various animals such as rhinos and as if dinosaurs wouldn't shake the entire wild food chain if they were alive as shown in the movie.<br/><br/>Watching the classic actors together again was amazing, but as planned was to convey the message of gender identity, they made a weak, pointless and bland plot.<br/><br/>I repeat, they did the same thing with Star Wars, they put together everything that the creators (George Lucas and Steven Spielberg) built at the time and that was already validated by the desire of the fans and mixed it with personal matters without worrying about the essence of these franchises that are works of art in their originality.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Liked: Audio and effects<br/><br/>Not so much: Needs a bit more destruction<br/><br/>Loved: Seeing the original cast on screen.<br/><br/>Fun movie. Great way to end the series. Not sure what critics were expecting but for me it just had to check off on some boxes to be a hit. It had action, death and destruction, little humor, and able to trigger the nostalgia. It checked each one. I would've liked to see more death and destruction but I liked what I saw on screen. Great flick!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you want to watch a dinosaur film where the carnivorous dinosaurs are deaf, dumb, blind, and too slow to catch a human then this is the film for you. More than once the characters were in positions where escape was impossible if the dino had simply made a move but instead it either stands and roars while they get away or either moves as fast as molasses.<br/><br/>One thing that bothers me is they copied a scene from the original Jurassic World where a character either has an article of clothing or a cable attached to them and a large carnivore manages to grab it and start pulling them toward their jaws. By some miracle all it takes is a human or two to overpower the pulling strength of a 10 ton animal.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">How many T. Rex getting hurt does it take to stop this franchise?<br/><br/>The conclusion to the Jurassic World trilogy. The movie itself is not really about the plot. Instead, it's an amalgamation of references to past movies and fan-service moments, and I had a fun time.<br/><br/>If you rewatch the previous 5 movies leading up to this one, the callbacks would be so in-the-face. Multiple quotes, objects, and characters made me do that Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme. They were littered everywhere throughout the runtime. Even the ways some of the characters died in this movie were copies from previous ones. Not gonna lie it's pretty satisfying recognizing those references.<br/><br/>Even though Dominion doesn't offer fan-service to the level of Endgame or No Way Home, there were still a lot. Not all of them worked though, as some felt kinda cringe.<br/><br/>However, this doesn't discredit the solid sequences of actions in the movie. Once they forced the setup of the plot, the movie turned into constant chasing and dinosaur attacks. The sequences were handled well and created high levels of intensity. The jump scares didn't feel cheap or predictable, heightening the intensity furthermore.<br/><br/>I have mentioned many of the problems of this movie. The plot was basic to the bone. It's just there so we can have a proper movie. The villain character was the typical forgettable evil villain. The dialogues were corny, and sadly even the veteran cast members could not save those lines.<br/><br/>Overall, if you come in expecting a thrilling adventure with lots of service and homage, you will have a blast. 7-7.5/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">There are far too many dinosaurs and/characters to cover as a main antagonist throughout this film so what happens? None of them are antagonists. The only antagonist is a very boring, annoying Lewis Dodgson. I was REALLY hoping that the Atrociraptors had any significance besides chasing Owen through Malta. That was it. Just like the trailer. Giganotosaurus? Please, it was literally only there to fight Rexy and die in the end.<br/><br/>Dominion was supposed to show some sort of end to the trilogy but only left more questions than the audience had before. Just about nothing was tied up at all.<br/><br/>I love the Jurassic Park franchise and I've enjoyed every single movie, but I'm sorry, this didn't feel like the ""epic conclusion"" they promised.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">As an avid lover of the Jurassic Park series I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately they were not met with the cliche plot line and same scenario as every Jurassic park movie. I did have higher expectations for this movie I will admit, but it seems this movie was written more for money aspects than actually sitting down to write a clever plot line. Almost felt more like a James Bond action film than a Jurassic park movie at times. Definitely worth a see if you are into the other previous movies but it is my least favorite of all the films.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">What is the standard of films these days? Simple mindless entertainment is over saturated. I think having a fun, silly, mindless blockbuster is fine. But Jurassic Park dealt with complex ethical issues. Just because you can should you? Etc<br/><br/>Anyways it was exciting to see the legacy cast back. Some of the sequences were fun and exciting. But Films like these used to have a bit of grit back in 1990's. In this, everyone looks perfect in every scene. Alan and Elie look like they just go out of hair and makeup. Perfectly staged. No imperfections. Everything just feels superficial. Every bit of dialogue feels safe. Every character is almost superhero invincible.<br/><br/>Meh.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The plot was both nonexistent and a huge mess. There were zero stakes the entire film since every character was equipped with plot armor that made them invincible. The dialogue was horrible and the writing as a whole was a mess. The most egregious offense was that the dinosaurs took a backseat in this film and were not the focus at all. Terrible way to end a nearly 30 year legacy.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film is of course not innovative and is also a film where two worlds come together. And to finish it off well, it's not going well. The cast of the first three films and the last two. And then a story has to be made of it. And that's where it goes wrong. Just like the montages. The story is also not accurate in time. And the dolomites is a huge area. And yet the beasts can get inside in a short time. In short, the film has to rely on the dinosaurs, locations, humor, scary moments and good film images. The film survives that. Especially the scene with the water is beautifully filmed. But the bad guy isn't a bad guy and it won't work out. But it's like transformers. Dinosaurs save the movie. So it remains sufficient.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Going into it I knew this was not gonna be an amazing movie. I could tell they were running out of ideas and didn't know what to do. One problem I had was the pacing. Unlike it's 2018 counterpart (Jurassic World fallen Kingdom). This movie is just to slow and incredibly boring when action is not going on. The introduction of the new characters's were not as likable as I wanted them to be and to me should have been fleshed out more. But when the action scenes happened, those were the best parts of the movie. The sequence in Malta was very cool and entertaining and what I thought Dominion was gonna be like. Another thing that I liked were the resurrection of old characters. Without giving too much away Ellie, Allen and Malcom we're by far the best part of this movie. The old and new characters did blend well and I thought they fit together enough to create a good cast of characters. As a diehard fan of the series, I thought the movie was mediocre. But, it did what it was supposed to and had nice callbacks to the original Jurassic Park and was good enough to end mine, and others, childhood movie series.</div>

Nostalgia baiting isn't done in a manner that would trigger emotions as well. Too long and riddled with lazy writing with the woke messages: ""White guy is a villain, Asian dude is still too intelligent for the greater good, black man is the moral hero, women rule, specially badass if they are not straight. And look there are dinosaurs too !! "" you get the picture.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I'm a huge fan of this franchise.... even when people said it'll be rubbish I was a stubborn fan and stood strong. I'll love it no matter what.<br/><br/>Tickets booked for the full family for opening day.. waited weeks to see it. All excited.<br/><br/>And it's a mess... an insult. It's made a joke of the franchise.<br/><br/>It's full of clichés which is expected but to the point where we actively started predicting to each other the next scene that would be reused.<br/><br/>It's so cheesy but beyond comfort cheese of well lived characters it's uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>There was a few good action sequences... the swamp scene was cool. And the knew dinosaur with the claws... creeped me out.<br/><br/>But overall I found myself bored to the point I wanted it to stop.<br/><br/>The overuse of CGI made it even more silly aswell...<br/><br/>I know people will hate this review. I HATE writing it as a huge Jurassic Park fan but it's how I'm left feeling. Gutted. Should have just been left as was.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This review is coming from someone who grew up with this franchise and one that means a lot to me. I even think Jurassic World is an okay film and Fallen Kingdom, well that was the only Jurassic film I did not like. Knowing Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum we're gonna return is what really got my hyped for the film. I went into this film not expecting much and kept an open mind despite the critic reviews, but what I got was a very over complicated plot when it didn't need to be that led to a very underwhelming and anti climactic conclusion. The movie puts too much emphasis on this bug sub plot that just over complicates the whole story and tries to take it too seriously when Jurassic Park is supposed to be fun and exciting. Now the weakest part of this movie is definitely Campbell Scott's character, the villain of the story. He just comes across as so silly and cartoonish and every time he was on screen, it took me out of the movie. I will never be able to understand anybody who tells me they can deal watching a character like him on screen because I despise that character and his sub plot so much to the point where it ruined the entire movie for me. I definitely enjoyed seeing the OG characters back and it really did bring a smile to my face when we see them again, but certain things didn't feel right like Alan and Ellie's getting back together romance. It felt so forced, rushed and unnatural and this is coming from someone who loves seeing these two as a couple in the first movie and didn't understand why they broke up in the third. The movie also turns into a random spy espionage in the middle of the movie which felt very out of place for a Jurassic film. Once again, these new Jurassic films are replaced with more CGI dinosaurs rather than animatronics and I've gotten pretty much used to it at the point, but then again I miss the times when I would look at the Dinos and think to myself wow that actually looks real or that actually looks terrifying, but sadly I get none of that in these Jurassic world films.<br/><br/>Overall I really loved seeing the OG characters again despite them being a little under utilized and almost served no purpose other than fan service. My main gripe of the film is definitely the script with Campbell Scott and his bug plot when this movie is supposed to be about dinosaurs. If I had to pick one bad finale of a trilogy, I would pick Rise of Skywalker over Jurassic World Dominion.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I can't believe Steven Spielberg signed off on this. I won't believe he had this envisioned when he directed the first two films. And Michael Crichton is surely spinning in his grave. It just goes to show you that nowadays, if movies don't have source material for their backbone, it's better to just walk away and NOT MAKE THE FILM. I'm gutted that after nearly 30 years we're left with this as our adieu to Hammond's dream. Thanks Colin Trevorrow, you bum.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jokes aside, this was a movie that was really curious for me. The idea was fantastic, trying to find an equilibrium with dinosaurs after the genie is out of the bottle. However, the execution was really choppy, each scene was as unbelievable as the next, and that has to be the fault of Colin the director. It makes me miss the first Jurassic World movie, which I thought was the weakest, but he executed it already well there.<br/><br/>Maybe its time constraint, or stuff, but I appreciate the effort by everyone involved. Its a good ending, but really could have been a blockbuster, and it probably would in the box office, but not a blockbuster that Jurassic 1 and 2 were, or even Fallen Kingdom.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I was 4 when I watched my first ever movie in theatre, JP which has since been a childhood favourite to date and I've always made it a point to watch JP and the sequels every 1-2yrs. I had such high expectations for the epic conclusion, but left the cinema feeling disappointed. The plot was too stretched out unnecessarily with so much focus on the locusts instead of the Dino. No real battle between the Dino and humans. 80% of scenes are taken from all the previous 5 movies and put together for the conclusion. No original thoughts, lack of thrill and excitement except for the last 30mins of the movie which happens to be a remake of JP.<br/><br/>The only saving grace was the OG casts, it was nostalgic to see them together 30yrs later. The cinematography and visuals were excellent as we would expect, but that's that. I really wished they had taken a different approach considering how the prequel ended at the Lockwood estate.<br/><br/>Go watch it for the effects and if you're a fan. But don't have high expectations. I came home and decided to watch JP 1 &amp; 2 to make me feel better.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This last film really disappointed me ! It's a shame.<br/><br/>At the beginning, bringing the actors from Jurassic Park's franchise was kind of a good idea and only at the beginning, maybe the first 10 mn, the plot could have been interesting with the case of the girl... but it became a total disaster afterwards. Firstly, they all are superheroes, nobody dies, everybody survives. The trailer is a lie, i thought it would be a film about dinosaurs that escape all over the world, BUT the storyline takes place in a park, the biosyn company or whatever. Then, it is more comic than scary, seriously... I spent the entire screening to make dinosaurs talking. It's just a joke... The end, it's just the beginning of the Jurassic World 2... Why ??? Nothing happened in that film ! There's no plot. And, about the actors, it was what i was afraid of to bring the previous actors as obviously, the screenwriter wouldn't have killed them ... same from Jurassic world's. And the acting, especially e.g Laura Dern or Campdell Scott and final the scene Mamoudou Athie, well it is flawed, poor, overacted... It's a shame... Really, I do not recommend you to watch that film at theatres.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I'm sorry, but this movie was bad. Worse than the other sequels even. In fact, it was so bad I grew in appreciation for the other sequels which are by comparison quite competent. The set up for the movie is a great one, dinosaurs living in our world... unfortunately about 10 minutes into the movie it takes a sharp right turn and becomes a story about locusts instead. The dinosaurs in our world stuff gets pushed aside, and once our heroes board a plane to the Biosyn headquarters we're basically on yet another metaphorical island. The dinosaur action is good, but basically plot irrelevant and most scenes are too short. The final fight is totally unnecessary and in a way quite mean-spirited. The pacing is brisk and choppy, jumping to and fro between two separate stories. Some of the editing in action sequences is particularly obnoxious. The musical choices are also intermittently irritating, especially when the JP theme gets played loudly over dialogue for no reason other than nostalgia. The acting is good, but that only serves to make this movie more painful to watch, as the performances of legacy actors are squandered on this wasted potential. Finally the ending of this movie comes out of nowhere and is completely disconnected from the rest of the film. This makes Godzilla: King of the Monsters look decent.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Well, well, well. I had so much hope for this movie, I anticipated something really grandiose, but it derailed somewhere.<br/><br/>The plot itself was mediocre, but it was obvious, these movies are not really about the plot itself. Maybe, it could have been better with less character lines. I know, I know, it had a great feeling that everyone came back again, and we had new faces, but because of that it became superficial.<br/><br/>CGI itself, good as always. The dinosaurs were great, their movement, fight scenes and the landscapes as well where we could find them. However I could not understood, why they had to finish the movie with that fight scene. I don't really see the point in it, but it is my problem.<br/><br/>2,5 hours of playing time. Too much, definitely. You get so many boredom parts in the movie, which scenes are not neccessary in my opinion. I was anticipated a little more fights with that screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, it was not the worst movie ever, but definitely the worst, out of the 3 movies. I don't regret that I spent money on it, but it is not going to become my favourite. If you have some superfluous time and money, it worth a movie ticket.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">First of all, CGI is alright. It's a modern movie after all.<br/><br/>Now to the plot. Dinosaurs ""co-existing"" and threatening civilization? Um? Excuse me? How?<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure the military would EASILY kill all of the dinosaurs before they become a ""threat"".<br/><br/>But that's what Jurassic World trilogy is about. It's about suspending disbelief to the point where you need to be incredibly high, drunk, or suffer brain damage to follow effectively.<br/><br/>Characters are nostalgia bait. They make boring jokes that never land. Adding the original cast from the first movie to bring in the old people expecting nostalgia. Chris Pratt still the raptor daddy (cringe). Scenes are heavily focused on said characters. Hardly any of that braindead action you expect from these Summer Scam Films. Chase scenes are generic. Often look silly because raptors run funny and it looks even funnier chasing a bike down a street. Oh did I mention that the airplanes are made of paper? Yeah, apparently a pterodactyl or whatever is strong enough to rip apart steel? How? How is this explained? The dinosaurs are depicted as monsters with superpowers to me. Like what? Since when can a dinosaur rip apart a STEEL PLANE?? Let alone travel as fast or faster than one? Laser claws and invisible jet engines? I don't even know.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was made for 1-5 year olds with no brain activity to be detected. Also catered to adults who get absolutely baked before watching. This movie is a huge L.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ignore the bad reviews (unless you hate big dumb movies), this film is what Imax was made for. Lots of thrills, chills and laughs, it also satisfyingly ends two sagas.<br/><br/>My two complaints are, it could of featured more of the wonderful Jeff Goldblum who is brilliantly funny in this, and a little bit more of the dinosaurs rampaging throughout the world. Other than that, Jurassic World delivers on all levels, which must been seen at the cinema!</div>

The scenario license inspiration I think, and it revolves around the characters that have previously played in the series. There is no real action or thrilled with dinosaurs ..

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Despite some of the harsh reviews, this is a good movie. It might not be what everyone is expecting, especially from the short teaser-video that dropped before Christmas, but as an adventure movie with dinosaurs, it delivered. Also, it's not a horror film either, it's a family film. With all that in mind, the cast do a fantastic job and the effects are faultless. Sound editing is intense in all the action scenes, score is good too. The old and new cast work well together and have great chemistry. Jeff delivers some awesome lines in his unique style ""I didn't know there was a code"" and many others.. Bryce is wonderful in every scene, and her character has become super likeable, compared to the first World's film. DeWanda is incredible, a sassy and interesting new character that steals her scenes. Also, it's a movie about the dangers of genetic modification, co-existence and ecology too, a point that seems to be lost on many viewers. Go see it!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Usually I'm pretty detailed with my reviews but I'm going to try and keep my review of this mess short and not so sweet.<br/><br/>Once again directed by Colin Trevorrow, whom has done all the Jurassic World movies, this latest Jurassic World continues this trilogies goal of overcomplicating the once simple premise of Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>I'll try to avoid spoilers but this plot is set four years after Fallen Kingdom. Dinosaurs are now living amongst the humans but two threats are not only endangering them but mankind. A locust is now spreading to the crops on earth and a bioengineering company that is creating them.<br/><br/>Let's face it, everyone who saw the trailer are only seeing it because it involves the casts from both eras of the franchise, which is indeed cool but Trevorrow clearly didn't care about that when he wrote and directed this mess, because if he did, he would have come up with a more suitable plot than this. The original was simple and to the point, while this takes the scientific element way too far.<br/><br/>The performances are as good as you expect but everything else is an undeniable disaster, from the overly green screened environments and CGI dinosaurs that have somehow only gotten worse with each film. Seriously, how is it that the 1993 film that inadvertently started it all looks better.<br/><br/>So overall, in short, watch the first film. Heck, I'd watch the second and third film over this. There's trying too hard and then there's not trying at all, this is definitely the latter.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really wanted to like JW Dominion because all of the franchise actors are finally on film together for the first time. And they did the best they could with what they were given to act. But the poor screenplay to this movie absolutely ruins the experience and left me hugely disappointed.<br/><br/>I am not going to provide any spoilers-frankly there is nothing to spoil. Simply said this movie drifts miles from the original premise of Jurassic Park and the wonder of dinosaurs and turns into a jumbled mess of failed plotting and logic. As much as l liked some of the lines between Jeff Goldblum and Chris Pratt, there is absolutely no reason to see this movie-either in theaters or even at home. Epic fail!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I am a huge JP/JW fan, and I WANTED to LOVE this film, but I'm going to put together an honest review here.<br/><br/>First, the pros: The plot line is a logical continuation and doesn't feel forced. The way the JP and JW cast get meshed together works very well, in my opinion. The movie has some very exciting and suspenseful moments....more than I've seen out of a JP/JW movie since Lost World!!<br/><br/>Now, the cons: It is a slow moving film, and the VAST majority of the exciting and suspenseful moments occur in a 30 minute window near the end of the film. I wish there was more. There are definitely some great action sequences at the start and middle of the film, and they are FUN, but they are predictable and, therefore, don't build suspense. My final criticism is on the CGI. Honestly, there were some sequences where the CGI did NOT look fluid, but rather looked choppy and lower quality than anything since the original JP. It almost felt like their CGI budget was cut or something. The most exciting sequences, the CGI was spot on, but in other sequences, it was just WEIRD to watch.<br/><br/>All in all, I give this film 8 stars since the plot was logical/believable, the acting was good (VERY good acting by the original JP cast), and the end of the movie saved the day by bringing in some REAL suspense.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I will be honest, I enjoyed this film. I watched it in theaters and it was fun. But the film has some flaws. Like, why not show us some funny scenes with the dinosaurs in New York City or Tokyo City? It also felt a little to safe, this is the final Jurassic World/Park movie, do something fun with it! I also noticed how quick they got rid of some characters that could've been a good main villain, why did they get rid of them so fast you may ask?<br/><br/>SO THEY CAN HAVE THE LITERAL SHAVING CREAM GUY FROM THE FIRST JURASSIC PARK TRILOGY BE THE VILLAIN! WHAT THE HELL!<br/><br/>They just have the Shaving Cream Guy as this knockoff Steve Jobs rich guy and it was kinda stupid. But I will say that I enjoyed some of the Dino chase scenes. Chris Pratt was also funny, and Alan Grant was there as a lame Indiana Jones. Anyway, go watch Jurassic World: Dominion and form your own opinion if you want, I'm out.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I didn't enjoy Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom and it was a sign that this franchise had run it's course. Dominion is the final nail in the coffin in what I'd hoped would be a fun film with plenty of dinosaur action, a sense of danger and adventure and a few callbacks to the first film seeing as the original cast were brought back.<br/><br/>Well the film delivers on very little of that, the plot is not only ridiculous but it's also very boring and never takes off. I'm just expecting a film on par with Jurassic Park here, it's never going to happen but in an attempt to try and bring something new to the franchise Dominion has lost all sense of why I've enjoyed most of the sequels.<br/><br/>It reminds me a bit of Star Wars The Last Jedi, a film that wanted to be so radically different from any other Star Wars film that it lost sight of what I enjoy about these films. Also same with Shane Black's The Predator from 2018, stop trying to drastically change the formula so much to the point where we're paying to see a film that's not how it's been marketed as at all.<br/><br/>When you watch a Jurassic film you want a sense of dread and danger as we wonder who will meet a cruel fate next to one of the dinosaurs and who will survive and escape. I don't want boring subplots about a kidnapped girl who is a clone of some character that we see for the first time in this film. It's a waste of time in a film that's already overlong and overstuffed with filler. Without sounding old and cynical I miss the days of the briskly paced Lost World and Jurassic Park 3. Heck Dominion doesn't even feel like a conclusive chapter or has any sense of finality to the 6 films.<br/><br/>I'd say don't waste your time and money, if you want to watch a Jurassic film you're better off just watching any of the other films (except maybe Fallen Kingdom) or watching Prehistoric Planet if you want a dinosaur fix. Dominion is a dull, soulless cash-grab of a sequel that fails to conclude these films in a satisfying way and as a standalone film it lacks the fun and thrills of previous sequels in the franchise.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">My wife, my 10yr old son and I just came back from a matinee showing. We LOVED it. Sure it's not perfect, sure there's slower exposition bits but at the end of the day it's a loud smash bash Dino adventure with great action set pieces ( one motorbike sequence better than any Bond film). Some of the one-liners don't land but who cares?? The old gang are back together and there's a keeping family together sub plot which is cute. Don't over think it for crying out loud - it's a Jurrasic Park film and it's great. Unpopular opinion for you - I had more fun watching this than I did last week watching Maverick (which is still pretty great). See it for what it is - fun.</div>

They were trying to be comical and the punchline to didn't land. Everything in the movie was extremely random.<br/><br/>Claire just happened to run into the pilot randomly who saw the kidnapping.<br/><br/>The original scientist behind the dinosaurs was randomly experimenting on giant locusts which never tied back into the storyline.<br/><br/>The girl was a clone from a Jurassic park character that never existed. And they never explain what the purpose of her clone or dna is/was.<br/><br/>The little clone girl was randomly with Owen and Claire as a daughter.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs somehow got off the island as a hole and spreads throughout the entire world.<br/><br/>The movie is a bunch of random nothingness. The action scenes were good but spare yourself the 2.5 hours and money to watch it.<br/><br/>Watch the trailer and you will watch the movie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I went to see Jurassic World Dominion last night in IMAX and was surprised at just how much I enjoyed it. I wasn't expecting to like it, but I actually like it so much that I want to see it again on the big screen.<br/><br/>Sure, the return of old characters are in place to give fan service to those of us who love the original movie. And ok, the story line is a little light. But if you can get past these 2 minor issues, you will really enjoy the movie. Laura Dern and the rest of the cast all look great, and Jeff Goldblum plays his best Jeff Goldblum since Thor: Ragnarok. Everyone clearly had alot of fun making this movie.<br/><br/>The stars of the movie are of course, the Dinosaurs, and wow the artists and wizards behind the scenes really went all out this time. At a time where we are all used to VFX and where they can all seem kind of bland, Dominion really takes things to the next level. I don't quite understand what I am seeing, but the level of realism has been turned up to 1000. I wish I could describe it better.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes which really stood out. A scene with Bryce Dallas Howard's ""Clair Dearing"" being chased though city streets and buildings by a Dinosaur, all seemingly shot with hand-held cameras, was especially well done.<br/><br/>Anyway, ignore the haters and treat yourself.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I didn't like the second part of the second movie but they continued the story from there I didn't care about the clone girl story or the grasshopper extinction story all I wanted is see a dinosaur with a good story which neither of them was it felt like some random action movie where they added dinosaur later lmao it's so frustrating to see all of the good franchise die Jurassic world dominion was the worst Jurassic movie out of 6 I hope they let it die and don't try to milk this franchise to extinction<br/><br/>I didn't even like any of the main characters from the new movies they tried so hard to cast the same actors for different characters like Clair and Owen they didn't bother to act in this movie. Clair was totally opposite to her character from the first movie and they made Owen into an average action movie hero to save the world wow wow wow<br/><br/>they are just making billions of dollars from the success of the first trilogy the new trilogy felt like downgraded ver of the original trilogy. In the first movies they destroyed the parks and then they made two parts of Jurassic Park 2 called fallen Kingdom and dominion<br/><br/>I would rate this 0 for wasting my time but I'm only rating it 3/10 just for the animators good job to them I really like the movie where dinosaurs showed up and they added new species I really liked them to see on the big screen.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was a lot of fun. It had a lot of great references to the earlier Jurassic movies and some great character moments. It's jammed full of action, sometimes going over the top.<br/><br/>For some reason the movie was dark in the theater I watched it in and was made even darker when I put on the 3D glasses. Looking at the trailer I'm guessing it will be brighter in Blu Ray format. There's not a lot of great 3D moments in it, either but the movie still works. If you like the behind the scenes videos I'm sure when it's released the disk will be chock full with info. There's a whole slew of amazing sequences in this film.<br/><br/>Once it gets started it's a non-stop thrill ride right up the end. It also has some very satisfying personal endings for the characters. Lots of fun. Get your popcorn and enjoy!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">They literally do not accomplish anything in the movie. They start by talking about how this child is frustrated with the fact that she's stuck in a cabin in the woods hiding from the government. And at the end of the movie they're back in the cabin still hiding from the government.<br/><br/>15 minutes into the movie you know that no one is going to get seriously hurt. In fact the only two injuries that happen are that Owen's hand gets bitten (which was immediately forgotten) and somebody trips.<br/><br/>The final climactic fight was incredibly underwhelming and still included probably the worst movie cliche of all time. They also tried to have Jeff Goldblum recreate the iconic shot of him taking the shades off but it looks stupid when they reveal what he was so amazed by.<br/><br/>All in all, mediocre CGI considering their budget, terrible nostalgia-exploitation, bad acting, god-awful cliches, and arguably the most porous plot line I have ever seen in a movie. I'm amazed at the idea that anyone could enjoy the 2 and a half hours they spent watching a dumpster fire caught on camera.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This could have been Universals Jurassic answer to Marvels Endgame, but it's not!<br/><br/>Sure all the characters who survived the original movies are back for this 6th instalment and that's a good thing, which could have been even better if they'd shared more screen time together.<br/><br/>It was great to see Sam Neil, Lauren Dern and Jeff Goldblum back in action alongside Chris Pratt &amp; Bryce Dallas Howard on the Big Screen with amazing sound.<br/><br/>Campbell Scott's head of Biosyn, ""Lewis Dodgson"" seems to be modelled on Apples Founder Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>""Archive 81's"" Mamoudou Athie is great as Ramsay Cole as is DeWanda Wise as the mercenary pilot, ""Kayla Watts"".<br/><br/>However one of this movies major issues is the amount of time it takes to spin out this hopefully final yarn from Director Colin Treverrow.<br/><br/>Its runtime is at least 30 minutes too long.<br/><br/>Fun Fact: there are more animatronics than any previous Jurassic or Lost World film in this very successful franchise.<br/><br/>It doesn't always work though because in the subterranean cave scene it plays out like the popular arcade game ""Whack A Mole"" it's that clunky and mechanical.<br/><br/>In fact, it looks like 1960's animation and I'm expecting Raquel Welch to jump out in a bear skin.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong there are some cool creatures created for this movie that we've never seen before including something from a Thanks Giving Day Nightmare and the CGI is flawless and genuinely terrifying.<br/><br/>You will believe Dinosaurs exist.<br/><br/>But why are movie characters so dumb?<br/><br/>One moment they are saying ""don't move"" then they are racing around like ants, or another character creates a diversion while others look on instead of escaping.<br/><br/>None of them deserved to live through this fiasco and fly away safe in the Corporate Chopper.<br/><br/>Plus it feels like quite a few scenes we have seen before in this series...including trapped in upturned vehicles, seeking refuge in old outposts, another high tech centre for illegal DNA testing (think Isla Nublar etc), tourism options and much more. It becomes very formulaic.<br/><br/>There are some fun references for fans who've watched every movie that will make you cheer though.<br/><br/>This movie could have blown our minds with the set up from the previous release with closing Easter eggs of dinosaurs hunting surfers, but it barely touched on the real world problems of Dino's unleashed in the modern world.<br/><br/>Apart from the plot line of giant insects destroying crops and all that entails with end of the world philosophy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately insects are rarely as sexy as anything ending in saurs...they even admit that in their own dialogue.<br/><br/>If we are actually only 3 meals away from anarchy then maybe this was one movie too many that didn't deliver on the promise and I was so looking forward to that movie they teased us with in the trailers.<br/><br/>The ending is just downright laughable and corny.<br/><br/>Instead we get a Disney version of life finding a way thanks to Amblin and Universal.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Loved Jurassic World. Fallen Kingdom was an excellent addition and set up a number of thought provoking threads. Dominion feels like a poor cousin in comparison. It's a mess of a film and shows Colin Treverrow fluked the first (and best) film of this trilogy.<br/><br/>Dominion's trailers show dinosaurs living amongst us. But the film opens by explaining another bad corporation has most of the them back in a park. So much for setting up that narrative in previous films. So our protagonists head back to the park to rescue characters that have found themselves trapped there. Yup, you've seen it all before.<br/><br/>Dominion is bland, the action lacks any jeopardy for its characters and the dinosaur fights are...boring! A poor film that likely ends Trevorrows director career.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not as bad as Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.<br/><br/>In Short: The writing is poor. It's very predictable, very cheesy and had quite a few forceful and cringeworthy moments.<br/><br/>However, I went into this movie to watch something fun, not as a serious movie critic. I loved to see the original trio back, although I could have done without what felt like fanfiction between the Dr Grant and Laura Dern's character. Especially the kiss at the end. Just no.<br/><br/>I hated Fallen Kingdom because of the whole Maisie storyline. Seeing more of her character in this movie (Dominion) makes me like it even less. I feel like this movie would have been better without her character. It was almost unbearable. If they cut her character and storyline, the movie would have been a little more bearable and shorter...because this movie dragged.<br/><br/>So this movie isn't the worst of the Jurassic franchise....but I wouldn't watch it again.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic Park was my childhood. When the movie came out in theaters, I was only 1 years old. I remember owning Jurassic Park years later on vhs, and it becoming one of my most prized possessions. The story, characters, pacing, special effects, and music are pitch perfect. When the Lost World: Jurassic Park came out, I was 5 years old, and I did not see it in theaters either. While it was a flawed sequel, I enjoyed watching it on vhs. The music, set pieces, and the inclusion of more dinosaurs made it a fun addition to the series. Jurassic Park III was the first film in the franchise that I actually saw in theaters in 2001. I remember loving it when I was 9 years old, but now it is my least favorite of the sequels. The runtime is too short, and I'm not just referring to humans running away from dinosaurs. The dialogue and characters and poorly written, and the quality of the cgi was downgraded. With that being said, the animatronic work still mostly holds up, except the Spinosaurus. Fast forward 14 and 17 years later, and I finally saw both Jurassic World and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in theaters. The experience of seeing the park finally open in Jurassic World was such an en incredible feeling. It was the closest to capturing the magic of the original Jurassic Park. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, like Jurassic Park III, tends to get better when repeat watches, but it is a lesser sequel in almost every way. This brings me to Jurassic World Dominion. While the film does have tonal issues and missteps, seeing the original trio together is worth the price of admission alone. While I think the current reviews are a bit harsh, the film is flawed. I would summarize the biggest issue as missed opportunities for the characters and story. The movie wraps up all six films in an interesting enough way, but doesn't completely satisfy or answer every question that you may have. Visually, the movie is gorgeous, and it has the most animatronics of any film in the franchise, with the cgi mixing well with the practical effects. Overall, Jurassic World Dominion is a nostalgic rollercoaster ride that thrilled me, slightly disappointed me, but never bored me.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Speaking for myself. I have been a dinosaur fan all my life, and the Jurassic Park franchise is just as important to me as any work of fiction would be. There is something interesting about Dinosaurs and cinema, in that they have been in the movies since the 1920's, and even back when dinosaurs were just stop motion puppets before going all CGI, people were still captivated by just the imagine of a dinosaur, and thinking of how wonderful it would be if we could live in a world beside them. This movie, like every other sequel in the franchise is not a perfect film. But the first Jurassic Park movie i ever saw in theatres was Jurassic Park 3, and even then that film was panned by critics and fans, and to this day is consider a bad movie, however i loved it as a kid and even though i do see the glaring flaws with these sequels and these movies when compared to the original, i think to myself ""there is no way to capture lightning in a bottle twice"" the first was a cinematic marvel when it first came out, and even the same people couldn't exactly replicate the magic again when doing more sequels. But that still doesn't mean these movies aren't entertaining. After all, the Jurassic Park sequels are filled with wild, weird, and wonderful ideas, and these are the very same elements that keep us entertained. This movie is corny, there are a lot of plot holes that do start to add up towards the end. However, i won't concede to someone elses negative review. Because for all the bad parts in this movie, i say to myself, ""i do not care"". Dinosaurs really speak to us, kids like me growing up all have there fascination and love for these creatures, and so do the children of today, and future generations to come. Because in the grand scheme of thing Dinosaurs were the most successful lifeforms on this planet, and humans will still have the shortest chapter in the history of life. And what's great about this movie, is fulfills a desire i had as a kids, and that was seeing dinosaurs co-existing alongside modern animals in the wild. I actually cried in the theatre when i saw those scenes, since it brought some really wonderful nostalgic memories. So don't go into this film thinking you'll get a piece of art, or award winning material, simply go in and except to have fun and be entertained by a film you know is going to worth rewatching over and over again.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">So I gave it a seven out of 10 because I felt like it was an exciting Jurassic park franchise movie. I really wanted to give it higher, but a couple of things bothered me.<br/><br/>For one, We were promised a epic conclusion of the Jurassic Park/World six movie saga. I do not feel like we got that. This movie actually left so many unanswered questions, and easily left it open for multiple other Jurassic park movies. It definitely was not the conclusion I was looking for. The only thing that I feel like it did actually conclude for us was the stories and relationships of the main characters from Park and World.<br/><br/>Here's where spoilers begin... Other reason why it only got a seven out of 10 from me, is that I felt like it was not the storyline that we all expected it to be. I read in a review, and I completely agree, this felt like it should be movie number seven, like we skipped a movie in between. We left off Fallen Kingdom with dinosaurs getting loose in the world. And we got that Great teaser of the Dinosaurs rampaging through a drive-in movie theater. I think most of America was expecting that was going to be the subject matter of this movie. Instead we got a small little snippet of faux news reels That lasted about five minutes. I felt like there were some missed opportunities here. I would've liked it a lot better if they had focused on possibly the black market dinosaur breeding. That was just my initial plot idea.<br/><br/>I did love that they paid homage to the original Jurassic Park in quite a few ways. And I loved having a whole cast back. I still love The movie and absolutely recommend it, I was just disappointed it wasn't this epic conclusion to the saga that I thought we were going to be getting.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first 40 minutes of this movie is rough with dodgy writing, pacing and acting all over the place. The script overall is weak and struggles to support its characters. Big character from fallen kingdom like Zia and Franklin are sidelined here, whilst new characters are barley given any time to develop with the exception being Kayla (this is purely by a stellar performance). Bryce dallas Howard shines once again as does Dern and Neil. The action is good and the dinosaurs looked good. But the story is so disjointed and all over the place it's hard to look past. For instance we have serval human ""villains"" all fail to register due to such limited screen time. The main human villain is weak and given barley any time to develop his intentions just being generic. Overall whilst the actors were there and giving it their all and the action was great this film was killed by a terrible story. What a sad ending to a brilliant franchise.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I used to come here only to read the reviews, but this movie made me write one on my own. Simply saying, it was really bad. I always stay optimistic and trying to find a light in the worst but here.... Youtube videos of dinosaurs have more decent battle scenes than in the film. I'am speechless how Villain story and whole sequence was miserable and weak. Everything was easily predictable, so many unnecessary moments and what's truly painful is that most influencing dino in the whole JRW franchise only had short appearance. Not an epic conclusion to the franchise, but more likely epic FAIL.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I feel that this final film in the saga goes back to the roots of the original Jurassic park. It focuses on overreach of the power with technology(mainly biotechnology). It was a good way to bring the new cast and original together in a way that felt believable. Also added a couple of great new characters. The realistic true form dinosaurs were quite neat and the touch of nostalgia here and there was great.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">FINAL TAKEAWAY:<br/><br/>Overall #JurassicWorldDominion is Space Sweepers - meets Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - meets Jurassic Park - meets Peter Isherwell from Don't Look Up.<br/><br/>That sounds like such a great mashup, but the team didn't blend everything up well with this final installment. I mean, is it a bad film? Not at all. It's digestible; but honestly, this isn't my favorite film in the Jurassic Park franchise, and I am a little disappointed that it's the conclusion film. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom could have been the real conclusion to the franchise with some tweaks in my opinion.<br/><br/>And you know what...I knew the off-vibe this film was going to take when I started seeing them 1990 Dinosaurs sitcom baby dinosaurs (LOL). It just really changed the feel immediately for me.<br/><br/>OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: All action and tension scenes with the dinosaurs, overall pacing, the scene with the burning locusts is possibly the best moment of the entire film for me, the realism of the adult dinosaurs, &amp; seeing Omar Sy.<br/><br/>Could've Been Better: Better use of Dr. Lewis Dodgson, better use of Maisie, and the focus on/inclusion of the dinosaurs more with the story-the whole point of the Jurassic Park franchise.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Well the series was fun while it lasted but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. It was not a horrible film but it wasn't worth a visit to the theater. One big issue (for me) was the dramatic reveal of each original character as if we didn't already know from press releases that they were going to be in the movie. It made no sense to do a dramatic reveal, say their full name, then follow it with ""I'm a huge fan of your work"" whenever they met someone new or got reacquainted. Nostalgia can only carry a movie so far and the charm wore off within seconds. There were also many plot holes or plot points that just didn't make any sense. You could rewatch every single Jurassic movie and still not understand where they got certain topics from, it was a mess.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Spoiler free review:<br/><br/>There have been a lot of mixed reviews for this one, including a 29% rotten tomato score from critics.<br/><br/>I've just finished watching this and I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I do need to point out that if plot holes, unrealistic set pieces, and an underdeveloped political/economic/social world are issues, then please avoid films with dinosaurs in the modern world.<br/><br/>I also need to state that my expectations for dinosaur movies are:<br/><br/>1. Dinosaurs.<br/><br/>2. Dinosaurs fighting each other.<br/><br/>3. Dinosaurs eating people.<br/><br/>4. Pretty people to look at.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>It's mad fun, it's daft in places, it's thrilling, there are some great throwback moments. It's fantastic to see the cast together and overall, it's a great conclusion to the franchise ...so far.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have loved every single Jurassic movie. I always thought they were at least a 7,5 but often higher than that. This movie was supposed to show the implications of dinosaurs in our human world. The impact on the ecosystem. Unfortunately they decided to introduce a ton of new things without finishing the various plots that were introduced in the previous films. There are so many weird storylines going on that it is hard to understand what the actual story is about. Comedy is used in awkward times which completely disrupts the already weak tension. I feel very sad that this finale to my favorite franchise feels so hallow.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is completely different to every Jurassic sequel before it, and in this case that's a good thing - it's a movie for adults this time around.<br/><br/>The action and set pieces come thick and fast - there's not a whole lot of time to focus on the characters, but since we know them mostly anyway it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>This is the first sequel to dispense with the childish silliness that has plagued the series since The Lost World, and delivered a world that has truly changed since the original Jurassic Park. Now the Park is the whole world.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a little too long and there's some plot points that are a little messy (your hand is not some sort of magic ""calm dinosaur"" technique Owen!), but overall it's a great conclusion to what has been a mediocre trilogy.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Full of entertainment and action. Despite the negative reviews or Pratt and his hand, hubby and I enjoyed it. New characters, old characters in a world where humans/dinos need to live together. I am surprised that Neill, Dern and Goldblum came back. I thought that part was left behind because they ""started"" the park and it ended in diaster and Jurassic World is the next step with new characters. I hoped they would come back. Pratt and his hand did not bother me one bit because that is what one does when meeting a dog or cat. The animal sniffs the hand to recognize the smell of a person. The movie was enjoyable.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I loved the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie released in 1993 directed by Steven Spielberg, which won three Academy Awards and was, for a time, the biggest box office hit of all time.<br/><br/>This new film, ""Jurassic World Dominion"" is the most entertaining and enjoyable film in the series since the first one.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are back along with a very good Isabella Sermon as their adopted daughter. Also you have Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum from the first film.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music score are both excellent. All of the acting is great and the visual effects are amazing. A great movie to see in a movie theater. I recommend this film, especially to fans of the first film. You will have a good time. Go see it!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Movies like this sure love to remove basic common sense. The story is pure nonsense, since from the previous horrible movie (Fallen Kingdom) there were just like a handful of dinosaurs, along with that stupid ""THEY'RE ALIVE, JUST LIKE ME"" moment. That character's logic makes no sense, and I really don't like her because what she did is the sole reason for the problematic and dumb setting of this latest and ""last"" Jurassic movie (Dominion) to exist. Do the writers really expect people to believe that the governments and armed forces worldwide allowed these extremely dangerous creatures to just go about freely and multiply? Just absolute zero sense.<br/><br/>Speaking on sense, when movies decide to eliminate basic common sense on the human characters just for cheap jump scares and plot ARMOR devices, it takes so much away and make them less or not worth endearing.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Effects was nice but the rest was boring. It felt like they were filming two movies and realized it was one film so they had to smash it all together. The 3 original characters felt like they were filming a regular Jurassic Park movie while Chris and Bryce part was more like they were filming a bad romance movie that just happened to have dinosaurs in it. The trailers for this film are the most misleading garbage I've seen. The dinosaurs aren't evading. They have taken up territory away from humans and the only reason the cast are threatened by them is because they travel into their territory and the only reason dinosaurs are in cities is do to the ""bad guys"" in the film who's storyline came off as a last minute decision. The whole cast don't even have any screen time together until the end of the film in order to stop said ""bad guys"". Also the whole end of the world thing the trailers loved to talk about was over swarms of locusts and not the dinosaurs.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I liked the previous two episodes. I didn't have any expectations for them and I wasn't thrilled with them either, but they didn't disappoint either. The same is true for me with Jurassic World Dominion where the film neither surprised nor disappointed me. It was such a surefire good movie for me. Story-wise, fine, but nothing great. Of course, the action scenes pulled it off, which is a given for this franchise. On the one hand, it was nice to see old Jurassic Park characters return. Nothing epic or breathtaking for me. It was just good, like the whole movie. I enjoyed the final battle, although I thought it could have been a bit longer. But maybe there would have been too much action. Either way, a good movie for me. What the fans of the franchise think of it I don't know, but a friend of mine who is a fan had the same opinion, saying that it is a good movie and nothing more, and even as a non-fan I feel the same way. A good movie that I can recommend. It didn't impress but it didn't disappoint.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">In Jurassic World Dominion, there are many things that deserve praise. The story and its ending, visual and sound effects, direction, performance of Goldblum, action scenes, and emotional weight all deserve praise.<br/><br/>But does this mean that the movie does not have flaws? Of course not. Jurassic World Dominion has several flaws that can be easily noticed if the person focuses well in it. First, the opening sequence makes the person who is watching confused regarding what the movie will be about. But what is good is that everything starts to gradually become clear as the movie progresses. Second, to be honest, I did not find anything special concerning the performances of the cast, except for the one of Goldblum. Even when it comes to Neill, I expected much better performace from him. But unfortunately, that didn't happen. Third, the person who is watching the movie can feel that there is neither an upgrade nor a downgrade if we want to compare Jurassic World Dominion to the previous installments. It would have been better if they worked on at least one upgrade.<br/><br/>But do all these flaws mean that I did not like Jurassic World Dominion? Of course not. On the contrary, I liked it so much and the way it ended the story that started with Jurassic Park 1993. When it comes to the score, I give Jurassic World Dominion 8 out of 10.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. It's basically the same movie as the last one with a weaker and more tedious plot. But it just has more big action, dinosaurs, and previous as well as new characters. I honestly don't understand why they made this, the story doesn't even have a connection to the finale. Because it's about a genetics corporation called Biosyn who genetically made a big grasshopper (or whatever they're called) to snuff out humanity's main food chain across the globe. The dinosaurs don't even have a big part in the movie or the plot. It's just like they give these characters one last adventure before they can finally rest and coexist with the dinosaurs which they already did like four years ago. But overall, it was really a fun and exciting adventure, the actions are the best in the trilogy.<br/><br/>The cinematography, production design, and camera work are definitely the best as well. It's so aesthetic and eye-pleasing, especially when every time they introduce a new dinosaur and in the final minutes.<br/><br/>(NOTE: the movie can be too loud at some point, so brace yourself)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Four years after Isla Nublar was destroyed, dinosaurs now live-and hunt-alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.<br/><br/>The movie is driven by action and visual effects, with little care given to things like character development or a well-written plot. The pace is fast, and the movie is exciting, but it's forgettable. The dialogue is often cheesy, and the acting is just okay with Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Chris Pratt phoning it in. There are a few themes that pop up such as the dangers of messing with nature, but they are quickly abandoned in favour of more action.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion is a movie that is best enjoyed as a mindless popcorn flick. It's not going to win any awards, but it's entertaining enough. If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll enjoy it. If you're not, this movie isn't going to change your mind.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Due to this film being one of the first films being filmed in lockdown it really wasnt that bad. I felt the dialogue was a bit messy especially when Alan Grant and Ellie are speaking with the antagonist at the beginning. However, there were some good scenes, but again like most films it was in the trailer. Apart from that the detail on the dinosaurs is astonishing and where there is action there really isn't anything wrong with it.<br/><br/>Slow beginning and an alright ending. I would recommend watching it though.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very weak script writing.. Lacking authenticity. The dialogues were average. Performance average. Never really picked up.. Too much of making it for the fans. Ian malcoms character was ruined for me.overall poor. Too much fluff. Plotlines so disconnected. The actions were to convinient. There were good moments. Its nice to have some nostalgic feelings but it just didnt do it. The score is just wrong. Why cant they just stick it out with John Williams. The ending was dumb.. A threesome! Come on!<br/><br/>Lessons: steven spielberg should have just made a come back just as Grant, sadler n malco fid. No scare at all.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie really was all nostalgia based. Bringing back the heroes from the original trilogy to ultimately tarnish their reputation a bit with this movie. I'm not going to give a long description I'm just going to keep it brief and simple. No dialogue, awful acting and an even worse storyline. Some decent CGI scenes with dinosaurs we haven't seen before. But ultimately not a very good production.</div>

I think they made this part just to put an end to the story and make money out of it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a great movie! Great job meshing all the characters story lines from originals with new. It makes sense. Great action. Some jump scares. Romance. Comedy. Surprises with new and old characters. Twists in storyline from previous movie storylines. Revealing back info. Plot was interesting and evolved from the originals. New and old dinosaurs! The dinosaurs are in, what could be considered, real current world controversial animal scenarios. Great ending. Felt like winning! Hoping for another movie! The kids absolutely loved it! I loved it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This is the first real Jurassic Park (World) movie in ages. Far superior to Jurassic Park 3 in every way, and completely better than anything the Jurassic World franchise has produced yet. Not only does it bring back the original crew, but this movie is clever, fun, scary and exciting. If I had to choose one thing to dislike about this movie, it would only be that it's a hyper simplistic plot. But that's not the point of the film. The purpose of this movie is to wrap up the Jurassic World and Park franchise, and it does it perfectly. Yes, the story itself isn't anything too impressive, but it's about as simplistic and complex as the original Jurassic Park, which is what you want in a dinosaur movie. It's not about some evil hybrid serial killer dinosaur, or some weird special agent hybrid dinosaur; it's a bit like a heist film with plenty of dinosaurs all throughout. The CGI is amazing, the acting is great, and the variety of creature is immense. But the best two things about this movie are the themes and stunning cinematography. The action scenes are jam packed with motion and power, without being overwhelming, and the dinosaurs are stunning and beautiful. Most scenes incorporating them are immaculate, visual, artistic, and inspiring. Best of all this movie has humor and horror. The funny bits are not the stupid slap stick childish jokes of the last three movies. These little humourous cues are organic and fun, mostly made by Ian Malcolm, which fits his character. No more mind numbing half winded jokes that are just randomly placed in the movie for a cheap laugh. That being said, the horror aspect of the movie was intense. Plenty of scary scenes to keep you on your toes; big vicious frightening dinosaurs, and gruesome death scenes akin to the first and second Park (Not World) movies. Just enough violence, just enough horror, and just enough joy. There are also plenty of call backs to the earlier films, and some retconning which helps bring certain character development points together. All in all, it was an amazing movie and worthy of it's title. GO SEE IT.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Set four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Dominion has Owen and Claire raising Maisie alone in a remote area where she will not come into contact with anyone. However, employees from a dinosaur research company known as Biosyn Genetics kidnaps Maisie when she tries to leave as well as Blue's mysterious child. Claire and Owen set out to rescue them both. Meanwhile, Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler go to Biosyn to investigate the seeds that are left uneaten after a locust raid threatens food supply around the world.<br/><br/>As someone whose favorite movie is Jurassic Park, I am rather mixed in Jurassic World. It was fine, but it did not have the tension or thrill of the first film. I thought Fallen Kingdom was much better, but I am in the minority there. I thought it did a great job focusing on the fright of the dinosaurs as well as showing how humans can be just monstrous if not more so. I also thought the ending was a nice setup to this film and it made me pretty excited for the ending to this trilogy. Does it end with a bang or a whimper?<br/><br/>Let us start with the good. First of all, the cast is great. Seeing Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Lauren Dern as Ellie Sattler was a joy and they have just as smooth chemistry as they did nearly three decades ago. Some things never change with them, especially for Grant. Jeff Goldblum is much older, but he is as smooth and solid as ever as Ian Malcolm.<br/><br/>The World cast are no slouches either. Bryce Dallas Howard continues to improve as Claire as she grows from being a rather cowardly Jurassic World employee to a strong person who is not afraid to step into action. They even show how much she has grown from the first by having her go on a dangerous rescue mission in her first scene. Chris Pratt is great as Owen. I always felt that this has always been Pratt's coolest role where he is a bit more serious but he still has a sense of humor for the more insane encounters he and Claire face. Isabella Sermon is solid as the rebellious Maisie her backstory continues to be pretty fascinating. Of the new characters, I liked DeWanda Wise as Kayla Watts. She is a fun character to watch as she is skilled and energetic. Wise seems to have a blast in this role. The cast is great overall.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great. The shots look stunning as ever with some images that look almost out of a horror flick. The scene where Claire is trying to stay calm when encountering a carnivorous dinosaur showcases the movie's visual style perfectly. The dinosaurs look solid enough, though there are some scenes of questionable CGI. The action scenes are fun to watch overall, with the motorcycle chase standing out. The musical score by Michael Giacchino is fantastic and the sound design for the dinosaurs make them even more threatening. This all makes the movie technically solid. With a great cast, solid action, beautiful cinematography and some memorable new characters, why did I still leave the theater underwhelmed?<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion is a movie that I wish that I loved, but I don't. In fact, it is pretty disappointing. First of all, the story is a jumbled mess. There is so much going on that it is hard to keep track with the plot. Even then, it starts off so slow that it gets difficult to invest in the story, but it does pick up a little bit around the beginning of the second act. As much as I love seeing Grand and Sattler again, their role feels more like having them for the sake of having them rather than truly needing them. Blue gets absolutely nothing to do, though if you thought she got too much screen time in the second film, you might appreciate this.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with the story though is the fact that it does little build upon the setup from the last film. Dinosaurs running around the real world? That sounds insane! There are so many ideas you can create with this premise, but most of the movie is about taking down another evil corporation and destroying the locusts. Locusts? I came to see this movie to see humanity live among dinosaurs. The locusts are unnecessary and they hinder the story more than anything. The one scene taking place underground where we get to see how dinosaurs are used in a club is more interesting than anything to do with locusts. Why could they not just build on that or other areas affected by the spread of the dinosaur population? That would have made for some great world-building.<br/><br/>As for the villains, they are disappointing as well. The main human villain, Lewis Dodgson has one threatening scene, but he is not given much to do after that. I thought the human from Fallen Kingdom was better because he was much more detestable and vile. That was the kind of villain that I wanted to punch. Dodgson is pretty evil too, but he feels more generic. As for the Giganotosaurus, it is a massive disappointment. It hardly acts like a threat to the main characters, yet it is treated like a villain. I think they did not give this dinosaur enough screen time. If they focused on this dinosaur more than the locusts, maybe they would have shown how much of threatening predator this beast could have been.<br/><br/>Despite my rant about the story and villains, I do not dislike Jurassic World: Dominion. I liked too much stuff in it to call it a bad film. I just wish it was great. It should have been great. That is why I feel so disappointed and underwhelmed with it. However, what does work works really well. If you are looking for a nostalgic experience and/or you want to see some cool dinosaur action, you'll get plenty of that here. Maybe it is time to lay this series to rest and move on before it can get really bad.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Dominion is a solid film. Albeit it doesn't feel like an ""Epic Conclusion"" as Universals marketing team quipped, it manages to tell a complete story from beginning to end, with everything you love about Jurassic movies but with a twist. The main plot driving the OG cast's return is clearly inspired by Jurassic's SciFi roots (very Crichton-esque). The main plot driving the JW cast is solid and helps bring these two ""Era's"" together. 30 years of dinosaur and film magic comes down to this. Don't critique the film for what you think it should be, critique it for its individuality from the rest. Dominion is a great adventure ride (as to be expected from a Jurassic film) and easily can be rewatched. Be on the lookout for a *rumored* extended cut once the film releases on Blu Ray and Digital. If you are a fan of the franchise and if you appreciate the extended lore, you'll enjoy this film!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Just watched this movie, and It is truly great. The Original Character storyline and Owen and Claire's storylines are glued together well, I like their interactions when they meat. Having more would've been better though. The Giganotosaurus was kinda disappointing, It wasn't in the movie too much. It Just came back for the ending fight with Rexy and The Therizinosaurus.<br/><br/>The movie somehow made me scared that Rexy would die, But she didn't thankfully. I love the final battle scene, it was really awesome. It's the best since 1993 and 2015. I honestly don't know what people are talking about when they say the movie is bad, it's actually pretty good.<br/><br/>The Atrociraptors were awesome, the chase scene was done very well. It actually got me Anxious about what would happen even though I knew they would survive. The Atrociraptor scene was done well, the shots and scenes were amazing. They were probably one of if not my favorite scene in the entire movie.<br/><br/>The Dimetrodons actually gave me a jumpscare when they appeared. Loved the amber mines scene. Seeing the original trio together again was so great, especially just after watching the first movie before seeing this. All the references, easter eggs, and throwbacks were great and nostalgic.<br/><br/>The Dilophosaurus was also great, wish we could've seen more of them though. But Seeing them gang up on Dodgson was creepy. I loved the scene where he's in the tunnels and gets attacked from the Dilo hiding in the mist. I wasn't expecting that. I like the reference to Nedry's death with Dodgsons.<br/><br/>Was hoping for more scenes with Blue the velociraptor and Beta, was underwhelmed with the amount of screentime they had. Wish we got more, considering Beta being kidnapped is a main point that drives Owen and Claires stroyline. But Blue was very animalistic in this movie, I enjoyed that.<br/><br/>The CGI and shots were just AMAZING. Some of the shots of the dinosaurs looked so great, especially the lighting and CGI. The Music was MAGNIFICANT.<br/><br/>The Characters were great, I liked their stories. I loved seeing them all interact with the og's and the sequels characters, and seeing the original characters and actors back in a jurassic movie.<br/><br/>10/10, recommend you watch it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was certainly a good ending to the amazing series! I loved every minute of it and although the begin was just a tad bit slow, I'd say it was more of a calm before the storm situation, which I loved. I also enjoyed how they brought together the original Jurassic Park cast and Jurassic World cast and no one felt out of place. This is definitely a must see, but make sure to catch up on the entire series before seeing the new one.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not for the story, not for the new characters... I liked it for the pure fun of it. Yeah-yeah, still the same old everything and yet it was 2.5 hours of not falling asleep and totally enjoying the action. I think reunion of the very old characters with rather new ones was not bad at all... Yes, it was ""revisiting"" old characters and scenes as someone has commented. However, it was rather joyful revisiting and paced nicely all the way to the end. It was FUN!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Spoiler-free: I enjoyed the seeing the original 3 cast members on-screen together (which was a missed opportunity for Star Wars), the score by Michael Giacchino is brilliant and love the LEGO Sets cuz they were accurate to movie! Spoiler talk: the biggest problem with these Jurassic World movies is the screen writing they brought in Emily Carmichael who previously wrote Pacific Rim Uprising (another bad movie before this one), my favourite LEGO set is the Atrocirapor Dinosaur: Bike Chase I was surprised by the minor human antagonist of the film Rainn Delacourt I thought when watching this; ""Is he going to get a new hand?"" and then it was like nope he's dead and lastly I love the closure on both Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ellie Satler! Overall this isn't my favourite movie but it's still worth seeing and I'm giving this one a 6/10!!! ;)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">This movie is so amazing I loved every second off it. I thought the story was really fun and entertaining and it felt like it was like something straight from Michael Chritons novels and it does really feel like it's the conclusion for these characters. The characters where also very good. They executed the original trio very well and I just loved seeing them on the big screen again, the jurassic world characters didn't change to much but you do see more of that family dynamic in this which was nice to see and the new characters where all amazing especially Mamoudou Athie's character and Campbell Scott's Lewis Dodgson was just a terrific villain I really loved him in the story and Campbell Scott's performance. Also the dinosaurs were just so awesome in this they were genuinely scary at time's and they also look really good and their cgi was fenomenal. And the action scenes in this movie are just really great I was in the edge of my seat the whole time. I just had the most amazing experience watching this in the movie theater, it truly feels like the EPIC conclusion to the jurassic era. But it also sets up other stories that can be told now. But for the Jurassic park and world characters this does feel like it's the end of their story and it's a great one at that.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If you love Jurassic park, and know everything about it and will notice all the Easter eggs, from certain parts in the script, even to camera angles, you'll like, not love, but like this film. You can tell they tried really hard to make reference to the original movie here, which I appreciated and I enjoyed picking out Easter egg after Easter egg. Are there certain parts that don't make sense, yes, but it's Jurassic World, does any of it really make sense? Who cares, just bury the logic and enjoy the ride and have fun with it.<br/><br/>With some great callbacks and final resolutions for some story arcs, it's worth a watch for any Jurassic fan!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't know how this film is rated above 1.<br/><br/>I could have added more reasons...
1) Boring storyline - killer locusts 😴😴
2) The story flits chaotically between countries, places and characters so you end up not caring what happens.<br/><br/>3) Boring dialogue.<br/><br/>4) The same types of dinosaur scare scenes we've already seen in the other films.<br/><br/>5) Nothing new or interesting... I love Jurassic Park, Jurassic world this film however was very disappointing.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I read a lot of the 4 and 6 star reviews before going to see this film, fully expecting it to be a disaster of a film.<br/><br/>It's better than the Jurassic Worlds so far, but very different to the Jurassic Parks. Key word being 'different'. It's an action thriller more than an otherworldly jaw dropper, as we've already seen dinosaurs and I think people are expecting to revisit the charm of the very first film in the franchise for some reason.<br/><br/>I agree, the premise of GM locusts modified to an accidental extreme by yet another bioengineering company was not particularly interesting as a plot device and I would've loved to sea some more ocean activity with the mosasaurus and other sea creatures, but I was absolutely enraptured by the new species of dinosaur we got to see, especially the ones present in the game Ark: Survival Evolved - Deinonychus, Giganotosaurus, Therizinosaurus, and more! There's a very entertaining giant dinosaur fight as well.<br/><br/>Overall, very entertaining, immersive film, not groundbreaking, but it has romance, action to the extent of Fast and Furious stunts with black market traders and raptor chases, new dinosaurs, a backstory for Maisy, old characters revisited, and science! You can't have it all.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I like how they first showed Dinosaurs roaming across the world and becoming serious threats to humankind. There were four super nostalgic scenes in that movie when Ellie satler returns,Alan Grant returns,Ian Malcolm returns&amp;when all three meets!<br/><br/>Glad to see they built up the relationship between Claire&amp;Owen also showing feelings between Ellie and Grant. Also they introduced some awesome new characters like Kayla and Rhampsy they did a great job honestly.<br/><br/>When it comes to CGI Therizinosaurus was fantastic but Blue was just little bit awful comparing to other JW movies! And the animatronics of Giga not that much amazing it had to be better but I appreciate that fantastic detailed body of Giga.<br/><br/>Most of the people don't like the story of locusts but I think it's great and different experience anyway the movie still feels Jurassic!<br/><br/>We didn't see some Dinos and new species on screen for long time it feels bad! Don't know why they didn't tell that much of story about Giga. Alan Grant said ""it's the biggest carnivore the world has ever seen"" but it didn't become a big threat. Actually Indominus Rex was way more terrifying and bigger threat. Actually love how Lewis Dodson died it's similar to how Denis Nedry died. Movie ended up by showing that all the other living beings coexist with Dinosaurs
""Life Finds A Way""<br/><br/>But the movie had lot of amazing stunts&amp;lovely scenes so, it's probably worth watching two times in theatre!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">After reading some of the god awful reviews of this film, I had very low expectations.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park like a lot of people is one of my favourite films ever.<br/><br/>When jurassic word came out, I liked it but it also lacked something for me.<br/><br/>Then fallen Kingdom came out, and for me it was a mess very much like the lost world. Didn't live up to its original.<br/><br/>For me this is the second best Jurassic movie after jurassic Park. So nostalgic, and wrapped up a lot of things. The social commentary was amazing and so apt.<br/><br/>Please go see this, it was non stop from start to end. Very tense, and quite a few jumps.<br/><br/>I don't understand how some reviews are saying it was boring.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">You see from beggining to end there is no care about this movie. Nothing makes sense, the animal behaviour, the characters interaction look unnatural and dont make sense too, they just meet and help eachother cause yes, no real realtion stablished between them, raptors are still puppies with scales. The giga was supposed to be like the joker and he was literally the ONLY animal with a natural behavior. Maisies backstory doesnt make sense and its rubbish, the locust plot is also mid, shouldnt have been used for a movie like this, specially with all the doors that were opened with the last movie. This movie says its going to work on how to deal with the dinosaurs living with us but its stays the same. No action seems to have consequences. EVERYTHING is EXTREMELY convenient. No tension at all and Ellie with Alan is very artificial realtionship. Why make more movies if they are going to be like this.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie is definitely not as bad as people have been saying. It is long, but you know that going into the movie. The reunion of old cast and meeting up with the new cast is fun and there is a lot of action. The story mimics the original Jurassic park, which I found fun.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not the worst, but far from be the best, the six installment of the franchise is rumored to be the final chapter.<br/><br/>A good closure is to put together most of the familiar faces of the Jurassic saga, even the dinos, that have aged better than humans. Although it deserves a sound clap the good shape of the original trio have after almost 30 years (even the villain looks still juvenile)<br/><br/>An additional entertainment is to identify the many references to the other Jurassic movies and other films as well. There's one chase sequence that easily fits in a James Bond Movie, and Sam Neil plays to replicate Indy Jones in the cavern.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day this is good CGI fun. It is advisable to see it in a movie theater since the sound has a stellar role.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I thought the theatre audio and environment really helped ramp up the tension when they're being chased and hunted by dinosaurs. Otherwise, the plot surrounding it is poor, dull scenes and conversations, humor doesn't hit, predictable story with tons of tropes.<br/><br/>Basically, watch this in theaters to see some impressive CGI dinosaurs tear stuff up, because thats where I felt like I was enjoying the movie, and theres plenty of that thankfully. I cant see any other redeeming quality to watch this movie.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Here's a plot you may expect for this final film given dinosaurs have been let loose all over the world: the new &amp; old gang must now go on a globe-trotting adventure rounding up loose dinosaurs &amp; shutting down black markets and/or rich people who are still buying/capturing dinosaurs for their own nefarious intentions. There are actually elements of this pitch in the movie, but the core plot doesn't have anything to do with dinosaurs themselves. The dinos are just sort of there for the most part &amp; function as obstacles, rather than being the focus or point of the movie.<br/><br/>Characters are given non-dinosaur related things to do. There are no character archs or growth. I really didn't care about anyone, even the returning cast, and at no time did I fear anything bad would happen to anybody who isn't clearly a bad guy. Characters that I somewhat liked from the previous movie show up, but then are forgotten about, while new characters are introduced that I didn't care about at all.<br/><br/>There were way too many homages &amp; recreated scenes from the first movie, and yet this movie lacked even what little spirit the previous two movies had. There are themes of irrevocable change due to tampering with genetics &amp; resurrecting creatures that aren't even dinosaurs &amp; yet everything wraps up nicely for no good reason at the end.<br/><br/>I give 1 star for the CGI dinos when they are on screen, another for a few of the action scenes, and a final star for the sounds design because it is still top notch. But that's it. I could only recommend watchingthis if it gets added to a streaming service you already pay for or a free one with ads.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Hi there! I'm a corporate media behemoth - and I'm here to tell you how a film as spectacularly bad as Jurassic World Dominion gets made.<br/><br/>You might be wondering how a film like this can be so unbelievably shoddy, when the original was such an incredible cinematic feat. Well you see, A Corporate media behemoth, like me, is the foundation for building such a terrible thing. It starts with an endless pursuit of more money and a desire to exploit people's desperate desire for nostalgic reminders of simpler times before everything in the world became too much, often satisfied by the feeling they found in old cinematic masterpieces. And sometimes, films that came out many years ago, sometimes about dinosaurs, left their copyright for us to exploit. We just had to know where to look! Around about 30 years ago, there were film companies, just like today. And just like today, they fed on the attention of animals,. Even humans! Sometimes, after spewin' out a movie, the media company would land on something that audiences enjoyed - something that had well rounded characters, with clear rationale desires, real emotions and relationships, and concepts that catapulted audiences imaginations and transported them to new worlds - Even ones with dinosaurs. The media company would make the successful film, make tonnes of money, but then, like a prehistoric mosquito, they'd get stuck in the sap of success. After a long time, media executives at the company realise that they are sitting on this old fossil that made them lots of money and think, by cloning it, they could make just as much money as the first time if they just made the film again. They know they'll never capture the true form of the original, the magic that audiences felt; but they think that, by taking the same actors, the same basic ideas (eg ""dinosaurs are back!"") and throw it together on screen under a similar title to the original, people will pay money to see it, out of some desperation to re experience the excitement of the first film. Media behemoth executives use something we call ""money"" to persuade original cast members to sign up to remake this movie, and base the direction of the movie on what focus groups and ""data"" tell them what audiences supposedly want. This will inevitably be contradictory and miss the real elements that made the original so good; but they will ignore important cinematic principles like good scriptwriting, dramatic tension, good character arks or sensible direction or acting, and... bingo! You have a money making, but truly terrible, soulless clone - or ""sequel"" - that misses everything that gave the original merit; something that is soulless and ultimately tarnishes the Magic of the original.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The flaws in Jurassic World Dominion can be traced back to Jurassic World and especially Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom.<br/><br/>Jurassic World was somewhat of a remake of Jurassic Park. The difference was a fully operational park and a hybrid dinosaur. And it was just less good than the original. But still a very enjoyable movie in it's own right. Storywise it didn't do much to lead up to the events in Jurassic World Dominion though. This is where the problems started but the real problem is it's sequel.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom was just a mediocre movie. I loved the opening scene and the Gothic horror scenes in Lockwood Manor but the rest of the movie was pretty much subpar and very shallow. Storywise it didn't do anything for the franchise at all. It was just so empty. The movie didn't do anything to lead up to the events in Jurassic World Dominion, except let the dino's escape.<br/><br/>When watching Jurassic World Dominion I felt the movie suffered from the empty story Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom provided us with. It felt like the movie wanted to make up for this. Because of this, the plot felt shallow at times and many events and characters just dropped out of thin air without getting any kind of lead up story in the previous movies. Too many stories and characters are in this movie without an explanation. Did they have a choice though? No. There wasn't a good story to work with so they had to create the entire story for the last movie.<br/><br/>Colin Trevorrow said he always knew where he wanted to go, he knew the end. The problem is Jurassic World and (especially) Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom basically didn't do anything to lead up to that. Jurassic World Dominion did provide us with stories but there wasn't enough time to develop them because they were already coming to an end. Before you create an end, you have to work on a story and before Dominion, that basically didn't happen.<br/><br/>Why did I end up liking the movie anyway despite it's flaws?<br/><br/>I was smiling the entire time because I really enjoyed what I saw. It was a very enjoyable story and it was never boring. It felt like an homage to Jurassic Park and The Lost World Jurassic Park the entire time.<br/><br/>The action scenes are really great. That raptor chase is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Whenever a dinosaur comes on to the screen it's just stunningly beautiful. Gorgeous scenes. And gorgeous landscapes to add to that.<br/><br/>The original cast together makes for beautiful and nostalgic scenes. It felt to me they stepped right back into their roles.<br/><br/>DeWanda Wise was a joy to watch. As far as new characters, hers got the right attention.<br/><br/>What are the negatives besides the flaws in the plot/story?<br/><br/>The soundtrack should have been better.<br/><br/>The finale wasn't bad but it was too weak.<br/><br/>Queen Rexy didn't get enough moments to shine in the movie.<br/><br/>There were several stupid moments and that doesn't do Jurassic Park and The Lost World Jurassic Park any justice. For example, when an Allosaurus and Carnotaurus are let loose, everybody just keeps looking at two people fighting instead of running for their life, far away from two very deadly predators.<br/><br/>I love Chris Pratt but how did a dinosaur not bite off Owen's hand yet?<br/><br/>At times it felt like the movie focused on locusts more than on dinosaurs.<br/><br/>There were very few dinosaur vs real world interactions. In the second half of the movie they basically returned to a park again.<br/><br/>Sometimes it felt they forgot what dinosaurs are. I know they don't want to depict them as monsters only but there is a certain limit as to how far you can push that I think. The carnivores were formidable predators and sometimes people get away with too much in the movie.<br/><br/>In the end it feels like a lot of potential was wasted in the Jurassic World trilogy, not just in Dominion. In Dominion they really try to make up for it but they ran out of time to do it without flaws. I am able to put the movie into that perspective that's why I do really like it.<br/><br/>Look, I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan. I love the original. I love The Lost World Jurassic Park. Jurassic World Dominion isn't Jurassic Park. It isn't The Lost World Jurassic Park. It just doesn't reach the quality of either of those movies. But in the end it's a highly enjoyable dinosaur movie that pays tribute to Spielberg's masterpieces. It's a great movie in it's own right.<br/><br/>I get all the disappointed reviews very well. I really do. I went to the cinema without any kind of expectation at all. In the end I felt it was the best movie in the Jurassic World trilogy.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">As a Jurassic fan, i enjoyed the first Jurassic World. There were some great ideas, interesting park design, some suspense, with a quite good final battle. It has its own mistakes, but as a new beginning it was a promising restart for the franchise.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the sequel, Fallen Kingdom comes with stupid scenario, extreme silly dialogs and situations, irritating characters, and exploded Nublar island. Almost everyone thought it had gotten a lot worse than the first JW, and most of the mistakes came obviously from the bad scenario.<br/><br/>And now we have the 'epic conclusion', which is... i can hardly believe this, but Dominion is worse than Fallen Kingdom. Due to an extreme bad and stupid scenario, the dinosaurs are just supporting actors, the characters (even the classic ones) are weightless, and suspense can't be find except one of two jumpscares. The new villains are completely insignificant in all areas, on both men and dinosaur line.<br/><br/>This final movie is a shame on this budget with this actors, and the reason is the extreme weak storyline again.<br/><br/>Mr. Trevorrow and Ms. Emily Carmichael, you buried this beloved franchise with your stupid mess, and we are not happy.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">For most of the film I felt like I was watching a Hallmark movie, with occasional dinosaurs scenes. Although the third edition of Jurassic World is flooded with references to the original franchise (almost parodying itself at one point), it was unable to grasp its true spirit.<br/><br/>There are some very enjoyable sequences, such as the double raptor chase throughout the city. I guess I was hoping to see more of that, as sequences like this are, arguably, the new saga's main original contribution.<br/><br/>However, they are overshadowed by endless cheesy dialogues. The first hour could -and perhaps should- be cut out of the movie. Not to mention Owen's laughable ability to MIND CONTOL the dinosaurs..<br/><br/>Next time (if there is a Jurassic Universe or something) less pointless dialogue and more well-directed dinosaurs scenes.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">So I've never been a fan of the Jurassic series, but this one was pretty dumb. The overall story is so weak, and they always end up going to a secluded park somewhere where the dinosaurs live only to have chaos ensue, and dinosaurs take over while the humans have to escape.<br/><br/>The whole dinosaur whispering thing with holding up the hand is about as dumb as dumb gets. I only went because my 5 year old likes dinosaurs.<br/><br/>I wish I would have waited and watched it for free on most likely HBO.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yeah it's pretty much just what I expected. Nothing but average. Plot is pretty unoriginal. Repetitiveness is what really killed this film. It was too overdone. The repetitiveness of our characters constantly running away from dinosaurs over and over again. Breathing against each other and making sure everyone is okay and then oh no, another dinosaur! Lets run away again and breathe again. It's okay to have that every now and then, but when you do it every 20 minutes or less through out 80% of the movie, it's like enough already. Not that Chris Pratt and all these actors and actresses are bad, but you just don't care about their characters anymore. Even the original Jurassic Park characters I didn't care about and I absolutely hate saying that. Look, it was great seeing them in this, but they weren't enough either to make this great. Everyone in their subplots were not getting anywhere with anything. I do like how they had a lot of different species of dinosaurs in this though. Not just dinosaurs from the Jurassic period, but dinosaurs in the periods before the Jurassic that go way way back. There was also a really cool action scene in a desert city that was honestly my favorite thing of the whole movie. Bryce Dallas Howard and her friend are being chased by two raptors through the city, being chased allll the way to the plane. Then you got Chris Pratt on a motor bike, going as fast as possible with two raptors behind him as well. He barely makes it on the plane and one raptor manages to get on. That raptor then gets knocked off by the motorbike into the ocean. You'll get a kick out of that scene. But all in all, just be prepared to go to this with no story, predictability and yeah, a bunch of random scenes of dinosaurs chasing their prey. That's all I gotta say here.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">If I'm being honest, I actually really liked this one. No matter what people say, I thought it was pretty decent. But the problems come in when you say that this is the FINAL Jurassic Era film. The action, CGI and the way this film was shot were fantastic. But it's the fact that it doesn't really have a resolution in the end. I mean yeah, they defeated Biosyn but how does that effect the rest of Earth? The dinosaurs magically co-exist with humans. Like that seriously doesn't work. The script was also a bit dodgy but nothing too distracting. The plot was alright but again, some things didn't make much sense. Overall, I thought that it was a solid Jurassic film but should've been the first part out of two to actually end the franchise properly.</div>

<a class=""title"" href=""/review/rw8227879/?ref_=tt_urv""> Cash-Grab Written by a 12 Year Old, Unbearably Predictable, Painfully Unrealistic

</div>
<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The plot is that dinosaurs are on the streets all over the world and the people have to live with them in their everyday life. But then the daughter (or clone really) of the main characters gets kidnapped, along with a baby dinosaur, and the main character/s have to rescue them. Thus, it's about all the obstacles--the aggressive dinosaurs mainly--that they have to deal with. That's it.<br/><br/>The cheesy lines throughout this movie become unbearable. It's also one of the most predictable movies you'll ever see. Oh, the good guy is trying to escape a dinosaur, I wonder what will happen... Oh, the bad guy is trying to escape a dinosaur, I wonder what will happen... No matter how unrealistic it might be for the good guy to survive such a situation, the movie will go for it. Now, don't get me wrong, everyone knows that this is going to be a completely unrealistic movie. But at some point, it becomes completely over the top unrealistic.<br/><br/>I should also add, that the movie is not funny if anyone was thinking that that might save it. A lot of the movie was filmed at night, so we don't even really get to get a decent look at the dinosaurs either.<br/><br/>So what are the positives? There aren't any major ones. As for insignificant positives, I can say that some of scenery looks nice. Or that there is 1 or 2 dinosaur chase scenes that I might give a B-. But that's about it. In summation, it's 2.5 hours of cheesy lines, poorly seen dinosaurs (because of the night), and predictable dinosaur chases.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think a lot of people are channeling their inner critic self on this movie. It is an action film with great CGI. We saw it in IMAX, and with the sound, it was great.<br/><br/>I get the plot criticism and they got carried away with homage to prior movies in the series -- way too much. But it does tell a story and not a bad one given it is the last in a series.<br/><br/>So be a critic or just enjoy the spectacle, it is up to you.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">As the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy, it definitely had similarities to Rise of Skywalker. A lot of things were going on. Some fun moments. Great nostalgia with the legacy cast. Lots of dino action. But it also felt like they had so much going on that they ran out of time to highlight characters and make us care. I will always love Jurassic Park, so this movie got a little boost in rating because of nostalgia from me. Overall not as bad as reviews say but go in with reasonable expectations.</div>

I feel as long as this movie was, it felt like it was too short somehow. I did enjoy it overall and think most fans of the series will too.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first part of the film was lengthy and didn't have the usual Jurassic World feeling. There were too many individual storylines at once. However, from the plane crash over the valley, the film became extremely good. Nostalgic elements from Jurassic Park were used well, such as the dilophosaurs. Overall, the first part of the film is very long, but the second part really convinced me. I also liked the role of Henry Wu, who finally isn't the bad guy anymore.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I just watched this movie in cinema hall and loved it so much. The plot of the movie is better than previous one ""Fallen kingdom"". The CGI of the movie is praiseworthy and it gave satisfying feeling. This is a summer blockbuster type film and the important things are the dinosaurs and action sequences. The movie is a lot of fun and will fuel the imaginations and nightmares of children who watch and give parents a good bit of action. Sound quality and Actings are perfect there's no doubt about it. I highly recommend this one for watching this week .</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've never liked any of the Jurassic Park/World films except for obviously the original. This is supposed to be the last of the franchise. Again I love the original, but I've never really cared about this franchise as a whole. So when it concluded I just didn't care. Though it's another case of nostalgia-baiting I did like seeing the old and new characters together. Overall this film is fine and I don't think it deserves the amount of hate it's been getting. If you just turn off your brain you'll get some enjoyment out of it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Plot is decent. No real need to develop new characters. It is fun, fast paced and not so gory. It was a good way to wrap things up. It was better then the second one of this Trilogy.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Great diversity in the cast and a very compelling story with some great humor, enjoyed every moment. Loved how they brought back the original characters and intertwined everything into a connected plot. The cgi was terrific as well. Hope for more!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The movie has some grand and poetic visualization which is apt for the setting up of the next phase in the Jurassic world Universe.<br/><br/>Watching this one after four movies and almost two decades,the story line is although predictable but it poses one unavoidable question of why we really need the dinosaurs and how they will disrupt the food chain keeping the single principle of life on Earth- 'survival of the fittest'.<br/><br/>Things will be changed now and it's very exciting story to take forward with a fresh angle in the Jusrassic Universe.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt is very good actor and a star who rocks the movie with his talent. You will start living him more.<br/><br/>But there is someone else who will steal the show keeping the future alive.<br/><br/>A good movie to watch which excited me for the future additions in the series.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Just got back from a friday early afternoon show. My feelings about this are pretty fresh and may mellow over the coming weeks, but I was not impressed.<br/><br/>This is essentially The Rise of Skywalker for the JP franchise. Lots of fan service, lots of Spielberg references, lots of ""remember that from the previous films??!"" moments. It lacked any compelling story, making a Monsanto-type corporation the antagonist/bad guy with heroes/protagonists that make nonsensical decisions that serve only to propel the audience to the next action sequence.<br/><br/>I can't tell if this movie needed to be split into two films so each could breathe on their own and develop its own story, or if this script just needed several more rewrites to get to a better form. At 2h30m, its a bloated frenzied mess that has huge holes in the plot, massive leaps of logic, and no real sense of what it wanted to say.<br/><br/>The first JP was a marvel. Groundbreaking visual effects, one of the most memorable scores of the last 30 years, timeless quotes and sequences that entertain my kids as much as it entertained me when I first saw it. And no real heavey plot driven story. It was pure escapism. Jurassic World: Dominion is the sort of Frankenstein's monster it is trying to warn the world about. These hybrid dinosaurs, these man-made attempts to recapture the natural elegance of something less engineered, are to be feared as well as the people that seek the power to make and control them. The same could be said for the current decisionmakers that greenlit this to the theaters. Lots of recycled parts from other better movies to produce something loud, brash and just unintelligible.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't have much to add to other reviews. It was too long (son kept turning on his phone to check the time) and the danger sequences very repetitive. Dinos constantly trumpeting and snapping at people yet missing. I liked our original gang, they were great, Chris Pratt and. Bryce were just no good IMO. The girl was OK and the pilot a lot of fun. I thought the movie was STUFFED with dinosaurs. The ending was endearing but but wasn't that the same as the beginning, dinosaurs all over the place? Were only the big and snappish ones sent to the preserve? Does anyone care? Lost World was much better and I've watched it many times; no plans to see this one again.</div>

This could just be because I've watched the movies ever since I was like 2, and I grew up loving animals and dinosaurs. I liked that they Beaufort back characters, and the fact they didn't focus on hybrid dinosaurs, just the fact that dinosaurs were dinosaurs. I do wish, however, that they showed them in the real world more, interacting with people and whatnot. Also, this is a small thing, but SPINOSAUR, WE NEED MORE OF YOU!!!</div>

Got kid back.<br/><br/>None of the clips with dino's mixing it with general society like in the promo clips and no Rex at the drive in. Not enough Blue. Almost a replay of the 1st Jurassic world scrap at the end with Rexy needing a serious hand. Big giant genetically enhanced bugs threatening humanity story was a bit much even if it did have a part later in the film<br/><br/>Good touches though, Dodson buying it like Nedry. One of my favourite dino's from when I was a kid the Dimetrodon got an appearance. Did have some nice chemistry between the main characters.<br/><br/>Worth a watch but did NOT live up to the hype.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">So amazing CGI dinosaurs is old stuff now. Been there, done that. World Dominion is going for the nostalgic play by bringing back the original cast of the 1993 ""Jurassic Park"". That was cool, but somehow even with the original stars, the old magic could not be restored. The Francise has run its course, and the way they left it does not sit right with me. Dinosaurs have a right to live alongside us? That seems terrifying and not a happy way to leave things. I still give this movie a 7 due to exciting action scenes. I often found I was tensing in suspense from the action. And that is really what you come to expect from these movies; good dinosaur action.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">There wasn't much to this film. We see the 3 main characters from the original film return as well as the other raptor handler(whose fate we don't know as he just kinda gets left behind mid movie) and that's the most interesting parts of this movie. Rexy saves the day in pretty much the exact same fashion as the first Jurassic World movie. Blue is barely in the movie. There's a few nods to the original Jurassic Park film. Why does it sound like I'm not talking much about the story? Well because there wasn't one. In fact, there weren't even that many good dinosaur scenes in this movie with most of them being shown in the trailers. Why did we have to wait so long for this to be so bad?</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved every minute of the cheese and all the nods to the original Jurassic Park. The movie did a great job of keeping viewers entertained with action and dinosaurs!! And it wrapped up so many loose ends and provided closure across the board. Nothing will ever be the original but this was a great feel-good, action-packed way to close out the entire story. I loved it so so much.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have watched every jurassic park and world movie and up until the second movie the the jurassic world franchise there was lots of action and it was fun, but this this movie has you watch a movie about oversized termites that can fly, tell me one person on earth who actually gives a damn about a flying bug that rots crops, the only major point of action is at the end of a 2 HOUR AND 30 MINUTES FILM.<br/><br/>Tldr this movie is one of the most boring ones that I have seen in a very long time.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">What an absurd film this was. First you have Dinosaurs living in cold weather. An animal without fur, with bare flesh, running around in snow. What other lizard (cold blooded) species do you see out and about with snow on the ground? Paleontologists believe Dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Someone tell the people making the Jurassic Park movies.<br/><br/>How about Dinosaurs running as fast as Chris Pratt's motorcycle going at top speed? Yep, that happened. Or quite possibly the most ridiculous thing was seeing a flying dinosaur species flying at the same height as an airplane, traveling just as fast as the airplane, and tearing through metal with it's claw. You heard that correctly, bone being sharper/stronger/harder than metal.<br/><br/>But if you thought, ""ok, that is rediculous....there's no way it could get more absurd than that"". But you'd be wrong! How about locus that are lit on fire in a room to hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit and those locus while glowing red with flame and heat, fly in the air for miles. LOL, that happened.<br/><br/>There was a scene near the end where the two women enter a room to press a green button. There's a bunch of Locus on their sides, seemingly dead. Because why would locus be laying on the ground on their sides not moving? But suddenly when the power comes back on those locus suddenly come back to life and start flying.<br/><br/>Now all that is bad enough, but the plot was all over the place. It was poorly written, not sequenced smoothly, and it was just one of those films where you expect it to be on the sci-fi channel.<br/><br/>Would I recommend someone waste almost 2 hours and a half watching this film? Heck no. Terrible.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Viewed at the Cinema in 3D.<br/><br/>When Owen &amp; Claire's adopted daughter (the cloned girl from the last film) gets kidnapped by poachers (along with the pup of Blue, the raptor Owen shares a bond with), and Ellie &amp; Alan Grant (from the original film) investigate a budding ecological disaster, both groups go on an adventure that'll lead them to the doorstep of BioSyn (a ""totally not shady at all"" genetics corporation claiming to be creating a nature reserve for the benefit of the world's now wild dino population).<br/><br/>It's not really an adventure film ABOUT dinosaurs as much as it is an adventure film in a world that happens to have (lots of) dinosaurs, which may certainly sound a bit disappointing going in (and I get it), but if you set your expectations right this is still a fun movie. Sure, it seems to be bothered more with callbacks to the original film than it does in really pushing things forward (and doesn't make quite enough sense in some areas, like how a few dozen dinos let loose on the west coast, in the last film, are suddenly endemic the world over after only a few years), but if you're in a few more hours of hectic dino action (which I felt was elevated by the use of 3D) it's still a fun ride.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The movie was full of exciting and fascinating effects (as usual), but the storyline seemed too forced, the original trilogy's adventure/fantasy vibe has gone totally, transformed into a blockbuster action movie, full of clichès and overused elements. Forced and fabricated character developments, or no change at all. New, seemingly exciting, charismatic, but pretty much expected characters along with old, returning characters, who have acted as 'reminders' of the original concept of the movie. The story is still unfinished, could be continued with some new twist, what can be said about this - and the two previous - movies. The acting was average, neither horrible, nor astounding, as expected from a movie like this. Overall, it was exciting and fun to watch, but looking at it more closely, the movie didn't really have a point, it has a strong message though - the same message that appeared in every 'Jurassic Park' movie: do not interfere with nature's laws. The sensible outcome - according to this movie - is symbiosis and peaceful cohabitating. Humanity's greed and curiousity will never change, but it can be 'cured'. However, in order to achieve that, we need certain punches from life, or else we'll never learn from our mistakes - suggests the movie (series).</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Don't let my 5 star rating lead you to think this is well made movie.. it is NOT. But the joy of seeing Sattler, Grant and Malcolm together on screen again did make me a little sentimental and the dinosaurs look better than ever and will never fail to entertain me.<br/><br/>The other characters are quite dull however, and the plot is horrible.<br/><br/>It's just all over the place and full of tired clichés, starting right from the beginning with Maisie being a rebellious teenager who is mad at Owen and Claire for wanting to protect her from evil kidnappers. She's the clone of a brilliant scientist, a genius, but she definitely doesn't act like it. The whole dynamic between her and her new parents is very unbelievable and doesn't feel natural at all, despite the good acting of Bryce Dallas Howard, who now has to portray a totally different personality compared to JW 1.<br/><br/>Owen is boring and stereotypical as ever, his only value is his magical ability to control not just the raptors he raised with the palm of his hand, but also communicate/understand every other dinosaur. I liked the continued close bond with blue and her baby (yes I know they just want to sell cute baby dinosaurs but I'm easy like that, I love a cute baby dinosaurs. Hope Blue&amp;baby make it into a LEGO Jurassic World spinoff, so my son can enjoy them too!).<br/><br/>The new character, pilot/ dino smuggler Kayla, is just as cliché and boring as Owen: the typical tough badass with a good heart and a sentimental relationship with their vehicle of choice. I swear I've seen this a hundred times and they never get any more believable.<br/><br/>Same with the stylish villain Santos, along with the whole Malta/ black market setting and plotline. All of it, except for the dinosaurs, could have been part of any other action movie, like Bond or Bourne. It was still cool to watch, despite the raptor hybrids being very inconsistent in their abilities: they are as fast as cars and motorcycles, but slower than Claire. Okay.<br/><br/>The original Jurassic Park cast members are completely fine and charming as ever, it's a shame they didn't really get the chance to shine in their very underwhelming plot line, which often feels like a lifeless copy of the original trilogy and less like the hommage it was probably intended to be.<br/><br/>The main reason is the absurdly incompetent main villain, Dodgeson. None of the main characters ever has to be especially intelligent or even lucky, because he doesn't give them a challenge.<br/><br/>When we first arrive at the Biosyn facility, it looks quite impressive, like Sattler and Grant will have to navigate stealthily among a brainwashed cult of opportunistic scientists. But no, they are more or less immediately handed everything they need to get to the evidence they came for. We are supposed to believe that surveillance is so tight that they can't talk openly anywhere with Cole or Malcolm, but as soon as they have their keycard they can go wherever they want and suddenly no one is watching them?<br/><br/>Also Dodgeson has this highly skilled expensive kidnapping team but as soon as the girl is inside the lab she can just press a button and leave without anyone stopping here?<br/><br/>Biosyn captures and contains dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus but they don't manage to keep a bunch of burning locusts safe in an underground lab?<br/><br/>Hard to believe that an idiot like Dodgeson would have made it so far. His confrontation of Cole and his attempt to escape seem like they were written by a child.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on Henry Wu, who now has longer hair and a completely new personality. He's remorseful and kindhearted and in the end it's him who saves the world from the locusts (more or less off screen too), not any of our supposedly smart and courageous heros.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this movie isn't even the stupid plot, it's the complete lack of magic. In a way the new trilogy mirrors the old one, which started great but got steadily worse.<br/><br/>I rate the other movies as follows:
JP1: 9/10, JP2: 8/10, JP3: 6/10. JW1:8/10, JW2: 7/10.<br/><br/>Keep in mind I always add extra stars for the dinosaurs alone, because I just freaking love them so much.<br/><br/>This was the worst Jurassic movie of all, and it's a shame. Seeing all the main characters united for the first time should have been a great moment, but it was just so underwhelming and their interactions between the two generations was a boring waste of potential.<br/><br/>Personally I would have brought back Ian Malcolm's daughter in a slightly less annoying adult version and also given Blue a bigger role instead of adding new characters with lame backstories that led nowhere (Kayla and Denise for example).<br/><br/>Also Maisie should definitely have been given something meaningful to contribute besides her DNA.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is pretty to look at (not in 3D though) but overall disappointing.<br/><br/>I would have loved for the series to go out with a (big) bang.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The end of an era.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is one of my favorite franchises and i have always loved these movies, so it's a little bit sad that the latest installment in the franchise is the last one. It's the end of an era.<br/><br/>The Jurassic World movies hasn't been the greatest movies. The first one i liked, that was a pretty good movie. But the second one not so much. So i didn't really know what to excpected from this movie other than that i thought the premise was interesting, this is the Jurassic park movie i wanted since the first time i saw ""The Lost World"" so what did i think about it?<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Domino is a decent and solid adventure movie, and i enjoyed parts of it (especially those involving the OG trio) but for the most parts it was kinda boring, the story wasn't very good, the script was bad and the lack of emotions is what's dragging this movie down. I didn't feel a connection to any of the characters in this movie besides maybe the OG ones, and i didn't really care for any of them. So the best part of this movies Is maybe the last hour when the action kicks in and the movie has settled.<br/><br/>But if you like me love the Jurassic park movie i definitely recommend you to see this on the big screen.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes, I know most of it didn't make any sense - most clearly that you would expect that humans would wipe most, if not all, the dinosaurs our before they somehow took over the Earth. And that those giant insects are perhaps to big to survive due to the way in which insects breathe.<br/><br/>But there was enough twists and turns and jump scares that I enjoyed all of it.<br/><br/>Still it is by far not a great film and so much more could have been done with the premise, it's a big miss.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Its a really good and fun movie and it does bring closure to a lot of elements from the past. Now, if you thought that (spoilers) by the end of the movie all the dinosaurs would be contained then you need to get a reality check. I specially liked all the references to the first Jurassic Park movie and the closure to the first 3 og characters from that first movie plus the asian dude. And to conclude, her appearance might have been short.</div>

When it was announced the original trio was coming back my hopes soared. Boy was this disappointing. The plot had almost nothing to do with the dinosaurs.

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a disaster. This is a story of giant ghost rider locusts that were accidentally created by a mad scientist who actually specialise in creating dinosaurs. The whole plot is centred around these locusts, their impact on global food supply chains and their economic implications, the struggle to deal with the infestation. The dinosaurs are like some random background characters that come and goes every now and then, they come in different shapes, sizes, colours etc etc, like those background alien characters in Star Wars franchise. The story is so predictable and boring and the direction is so immature.. This is the worst movie among the jurassic series.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Okay, let's all say it, this one doesn't live up to the original. There, that's out of the way. Now, on to reviewing 'Dominion.'<br/><br/>The clear intent of this wrap up was just that, to wrap it up, and that task has been accomplished. Several screen moments harkened back to the original, fitting because of all the returning stars. There was even an oblique Indiana Jones reference that many in the audience laughed at, and the laughter could be heard over the ear-splitting IMAX sound.<br/><br/>The sets, the special effects, all the nuts and bolts get a ten out of ten. As
far as originality goes, I don't think that was ever the point.<br/><br/>Dominion succeeds as a final chapter, does so with nostalgia and good humor, and let's hope those who make movies understand that this story is over.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The latest Jurassic world has nothing new to offer other than showcasing a couple of new varieties of dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Story was flat, some cool actions from Chris Prat and that's the only high point of the movie.<br/><br/>It's not worth watching in the movie theaters. Hope this is the last Jurassic movie because of inability of script writers to come up with a new story.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I don't know what else people wanted. Great fab service oriented wrap up bringing the casts together and just action end of end. By owning the premise from the last one that dinosaurs live in our world it at least felt unique from some of the 'no really let's go back to the island' chapters. It's a summer popcorn it knows what it is movie but it's easily in the top 3 of the JP/JW movies for me.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Much better than the previous Jurassic World film. And if you are a fan of an action packed Jurassic World movie than this film is for you. With many easter eggs and hints towards the original Jurassic Park film, this movie ties everything together perfectly.<br/><br/>The Acting preformed in this movie was more traditional to the original Jurassic Park films. With a lower focus on witty humor and a higher focus on the task at hand with the occasional hint of humor, each characters personality fits them.<br/><br/>Having two different story lines going at once also helps add more action. Especially because at the ending half of the film these two story lines get tied together, which then forces everyone to work together.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved this movie. To me, this movie was like two movies - first part like a James Bond with dinos and the second part more like traditional Jurassic Park. Casting was brilliant all the way around. Loved the tie in back to Dodson. For me perfect way to wrap up the trilogies and keep in spirit with Crichton's original vision and message.<br/><br/>The only knock I have is the real3d version got a little blurry for me at times but overall the cinematography was beautifully done like all the movies in this series.</div>

Good dino chases and action.<br/><br/>Spoilers: they spent too much time talking about locust and making references to Monsanto. This reminds me of the 2nd Jurassic World movie where they talked about the militarty applications of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are scary enough on their own.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Jurassic World Franchise has stayed steady with both the 1st and Fallen Kingdom being great. With Jurassic World Dominon it follows the same suit its really interesting to see how Dinosaurs are like in the Real World ""coexisting"" with Humans and how that has affected the World. Now although I will say there are moments where seeing Dinosaurs is lacking but it goes all out in the conclusion with the Dinosaurs with a great climax with all the beloved characters we've come to know come together. And the new and Returning characters we met also are a great addition to the story so while some are saying this movie isn't good i give this movie the approval to go see in Theaters.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Watched the new Jurassic film last night and must say, was quite disappointed. Slow burner, cheesy, nothing new, lacking in action and defo doesn't have the rewatchability of the others.<br/><br/>Same lines, same scenes really. So lacking in plot and ideas. Could have done a lot more.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the franchise still watch it, just for the ""reunion"" of all the key cast members, but don't expect to see a singing and dancing box office smash.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Jurassic Park/World saga is based on the novel ""Jurassic Park"" by Michael Crichton. Crichton's novel is science fiction with the nuance of being able to discern what is possible with science and science what is not. The previous Jurassic Park/World's all have this movie, the only one that does not is Dominion. Dominion instead lacks the nuance that helped differentiate Jurassic Park, instead they made a fantasy movie that makes little sense. The only reason this movie doesn't have a lower rating is due to how stunning the cgi and visuals are (and there were a few jokes from Pratt and the pilot that made me laugh). Overall, pretty mediocre, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I would not pay 30 dollars to watch this movie in a movie theater.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Just finished watching the film after reading so so many negative reviews about it over the past week. I went into this already feeling disappointed. But I've learnt a valuable lesson today - the audiences in this day and age are so hard to please, even if the original Jurassic park were to come out today people would probably give that negative reviews too.<br/><br/>Don't believe what you read from the masses. I thought this film was excellent and was a great send off for the ""world"" trilogy. It gave me goosebumps, it made me feel wonder, sadness, surprise and fear. Sound familiar?? Another film does that too. It's called Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>I'm by no means saying this film is as good as the original. But it is MILES better than Fallen Kingdom and I actually think this film merged the original cast with the recent very well. Both groups were integral to the plot and actually contributed. They used their nightmare experience from the first film and used it to survive.<br/><br/>I could go on and write another 1000 words to this review challenging people who say ""there wasn't enough dinosaurs. Too much focus on people"" and to that I say - if that's what you want then go watch the walking with dinosaurs movie.. this isn't a Dino documentary. It's a science fiction film which involved HUMANS creating dinosaurs from DNA. People and their selfish motivations are kind of important to how the entire series has worked thus far.<br/><br/>If you're reading this review and haven't seen the film because you've been put off by all the negativity - then please, go and see the film and judge for yourself. Don't be the negativesaurus that so many seem to be these days.<br/><br/>And yes, I did just say Negativesaurus. I'm using it now.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""Jurassic World Dominion"" is the third and (hopefully) the last entry in the Jurassic World trilogy. It's safe to say the franchise has run out of steam at this point and arguably, it's been the case with all Jurassic Park/Jurassic World sequels since ""The Lost World."" At the very least, I anticipated that ""Dominion"" would surpass the mediocrity of ""Fallen Kingdom"" but somehow, ""Dominion"" wound up being even more convoluted and messy than Fallen Kingdom.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Dominion many problems including a rushed script, too many subplots, disposable characters and a very bland, forgettable villain. One of the movie's biggest draws was returning characters from the first ""Jurassic Park"", Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm, but even the reunion of the original cast members doesn't save ""Dominion"" from being an incredibly bland entry in the JW franchise, although admittedly I was happy to see Jeff Goldblum receive more screentime where he gets to deliver some genuinely funny lines. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the rest of the characters who feel underdeveloped and underused throughout the film despite a few moments where the character dynamic between the old and new characters was actually decent. If only the script was better then ""Dominion"" could've done a better job of bridging together the two franchises, Jurassic Park and Jurassic World"" and its characters and brought a satisfying close to the series.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Jurassic Park Dominion"" is a sequel that plays it safe by relying on fan service and even toning down the violence in an effort to make the film more family-friendly than its predecessors as there's hardly much blood spilled in the movie. Granted, Jurassic Park/World has always been a PG-13 franchise that doesn't rely heavily on gore although the franchise still didn't shy away from depicting gruesome dinosaur kills. In spite of the above, Dominion, which features dinosaurs roaming around on a global scale, somehow manages to be even more tame than the previous JP/JW films where it contains fewer dinosaur kills and violence. All of the above contribute to ""Dominion"" being a very average, by-the-numbers sequel and a good indicator that the dino franchise has completely run out of steam at this point and probably should remain extinct.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think parents must be dragging their kids to these movies, and neither the parents or the kids actually like them. I can't think of any other reason why these Jurassic World movies make so much money. They're all terrible. Even the original 3 from 1993 couldn't save this piece of garbage. And why do the 1993 special effects still blow away all the subsequent jurssic movies? And why is this movie two and a half hours??<br/><br/>You may be asking why I saw this movie. I'm asking myself that same question.... The actual answer is that I go see a lot of movies because I like to have popcorn with peanut M&amp;Ms on top and a large Diet Coke in a movie theater... And I already saw top gun Maverick twice...</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">A perfectly good Jurassic World movie, with two plots that gradually intersect featuring plenty of nods to the other films and still a ton of dinosaurs. I'm honestly not sure why everyone is saying this is a bad movie, I'd say it's 3rd best, right behind the original movie and Jurassic World. The bad reviews kind of made me hesitant to see it, but I'm glad I did. Take a chance and go see this fitting finale to the Jurassic saga!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">As someone who has read Crichton's books, (darn near all of them, still haven't read Airframe), this movie was all the things. Wrap it up, full circle, deep commentary on the scientific power we wield as humans with both miraculous and disastrous consequences. This is not a crowd-pleasing, no need to think, monster-action movie. Which is something Michael Crichton's original novel was never meant to be. At long last, the second franchise finally got back to the roots of what the books were really about. And I loved every second of it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ok I was so excited for this movie but I was so let down. Everything that happened you expected to happen so it wasn't even thrilling, Everyone survived you get the end Dino fight scene bad guy died big whoop. I wanted to feel a little scared like ooh what's gonna happen next. I literally kept looking at my watch for the time it was a ridiculous amount of fan service. I don't ever review movies but I literally saw it an hour ago and had to write this because I was so frustrated. This could have been really great if they did anything unique at all. The Dino fight at the end was so sad, and I remember being on the edge of my seat when I saw the last two Jurassic world movies. This didn't do that for me and it sucks. Really horrible way to end a franchise, ridiculous.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Ughh! Where to start! If it was some other movie in which dinosaurs were still alive then it'd have been actually good. Why? Because then you wouldn't expect dinosaurs much but their cameos would be exciting. Yup, dinosaurs were only making cameos and it wasn't about them at all. Based on that it was very disappointing because I didn't feel like I was watching a movie that's in the Jurassic park franchise. There were two different stories and none of them was related to Jurassic park/dinosaurs. It felt like one of that action oriented movies where heros do some stunts and come out scatheless. If I wanted this, I'd watch any typical Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Before I begin, the Dimetrodon scene was absolutely freaking marvelous. I looved it so much. But again, everyone comes out alive. It's not even about that but you won't even have a single scratch, that's not possible.<br/><br/>I also cannot believe that I'm saying this but Laura Dern's acting in the beginning was so so extra. I don't know why because she's a good actor but she was overacting in the beginning. Someone told Jeff to forget about about his character Ian and act like how he did in his Cameo in FRIENDS and he took that seriously. Sam Neill didn't have many lines so can't say how he acted and same with Chris Pratt. Bryce Dallas's character story had nothing to do with Jurassic park or World.<br/><br/>There was absolutely no need for the character Maisie to be in this movie let alone lead one of the story arcs. Now when I think of it, the character didn't need to be in fallen Kingdom too. Also, movies in general should give up its typical ""I'm a rebel independent mannerless teenager"" characters. There was also no need for the new characters. We know why they're here and not so surprisingly, they were righteous. Could have included Ian's daughter Kelly from The Lost world instead of new characters. Such a huge missed opportunity.<br/><br/>This also wasn't what they promised.(Dinosaurs and humans together in a chaotic world) They want us to be okay with the fact that they've trained dinosaurs like lions or some other big cats and they won't harm humans. Others that are not trained and are pure wild, they're not harming humans as well. Yup! You heard it right.<br/><br/>One thing I like is that at least dinosaurs don't look or act like cartoons like they did in fallen Kingdom. Also, I'm glad no one cracked stupid jokes like when they made the character Claire joke in fallen Kingdom ""see, not a t-rex"". No one screamed like a cartoon like that guy in fallen Kingdom and I appreciate that.<br/><br/>You're also supposed to be okay with the fact that t-rex/rexy always wins. Don't get me wrong, I love rexy too but c'mon like you've an apex predator like giganotosaurus and you're saying that it's easy for it to just get killed.<br/><br/>You're also supposed to be ok with the fact that therizinosaurus couldn't see Claire and seemingly appeared blind but towards the end could suddenly see conveniently. Btw the scene with Claire and therizinosaurus that you see in the trailer is the only one of the few scenes that's breathtaking to watch and should have been left for the movie.<br/><br/>There was absolutely no suspense, tension, horror or mystery. After a while, you'd figure out that all the characters are immortals. You'd figure out after a while what's going to happen.<br/><br/>It wouldn't feel like you're getting goosebumps or at least feeling significant excitement seeing the OGs aka Alan, Ellie and Ian on the screen in this and honestly that was disappointing.<br/><br/>It wasn't so so so bad and gets fun after the first half but I had to watch the lost world after it to appreciate the franchise for what it was.<br/><br/>Fallen Kingdom is still the worse one for me but I can't believe it's the second worse.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">People who expected a philosophical cinematic thriller like Jurassic park are stuck in the 90's. This franchise has been just about fun dinosaur action since JP2, and Colin has nailed it in that regard. This movie is quite similar to the last installment but exceeds it in every way. The characters aren't all dreadful but I actually liked most of them in this movie. The dinosaurs look way better too, party because of the use of animatronics. And the terror of the dinosaurs hasn't been this good since JP ( dinosaurs are scary again!) .sure the end battle was cheesy and stupid like in the last few movies and the plot was pretty weird and not really interesting but it's still the best JW film in my opinion.<br/><br/>People watch JW/JP for the dinosaurs and dinosaurs it gave us.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've loved all the jurrasic movies from the get go, this movie was a bit of let down. I felt they tried to take a little bit of the last 5 movies and throw it in one film.<br/><br/>The story line is what let it down to me, I feel there is some good elements in the story line but it just didn't work for me, didnt have the same feel for the last films. The ending feels rushed.<br/><br/>Love the return on the original characters from jurrasic park and characters from jurrasic world feel they made it worth watching in all honesty.<br/><br/>All in all if your a jurrasic fan still worth watching I guess the films been worked up so much as the ending to the franchise its missed the boat a bit.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Am sad to say that my childhood favourite.. and the movie which I grew up with... finally got ruined 😭😭😭... felt like the main characters from Jurassic park came in this movie for no real reason I can include the dinosaurs itself... action sequences are good of course Hollywood... In the previous movies Jurassic world and JW fallen kingdom the death of Indominus rex and Indoraptor made more sense... rather than this movie climax... overall I cannot believe... I got disappointed... 😭😭😭</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie had a very steady pace overall from scene to scene. CGI was better than expected, and overall the characters had very good acting and fit in with the plot perfectly! Some scenes were very emotional and heartwarming for me and the rest of the audience in the theater.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie was so bad I feel it's necessary I warn as many people as possible. Do NOT waste your time or money. You'd get more entertainment and joy out of licking a sand lollipop.<br/><br/>As everyone else has said, it's got too much of nothing going on. It's the only movie I've seen in the theatre that made me want to ask for a refund.<br/><br/>No chemistry, no imagination, poorly conceived plot, horrible selection of music placement. And attempting to give everyone a participation ""medal"" to appease and please varying demographics was so artificial!! Ahhhhhharghh!! It's so bad.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was a fun film and gave me pay off for things I didn't know I wanted. The first act felt all over the place but once everyone was in Switzerland the film soared. The score was ok but had some good motif moments. I was really surprised to see Dotson but it was a welcome surprise. I do wish that Biosyn was at least mentioned in the other World films and that they didn't show what was meant to be the Whipped Cream can from the og film that was meant to be barried and the grasshopper plot felt very out of place but the Dr. Wu redemption and Dotson comeuppance was great. The og actors carried the film and it was great to see them on the big screen for my first time and mixing with our new cast but it was missing more Zia and Franklyn (and Lowery). 7.3/10 not the best but a fun ending.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The pacing in this movie is plain boring and nonetheless horrible. It consists of the characters standing, seeing a dinosaur, running away from it, and the cycle repeats itself. So many unnecessary characters are there, many of which don't even get a development, and at the end of the movie, they're already forgotten. I would not recommend this to people that enjoy smart movies.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The whole movie is just 2.5 hrs of various characters almost dying, there is really nothing more to it other than a straightforward and predictable plot.<br/><br/>None of the characters have any real personality, especially Chris pratt's character. Everything they say is rehearsed and soulless, no one actually seems like a real person. The only line that felt like it had any real substance behind it was when Jeff golblum said that biosyn gives its employees a lot of promotions, and that was it.<br/><br/>The movie completely fails to create any suspense because everyone nearly died 10 times already, and that act gets old quick. The movie also has a lot of overused action movie stuff that should've been retired 10 years ago. The 1000th time I've seen someone drive into the back of a moving plane isn't gonna be any better than the first 999 times<br/><br/>All the characters are either 5 steps ahead of the audience, or bumbling idiots. It sure would be nice if ""how they used to cage raptors back at the park"" made any f sense and it would be even nicer if people weren't so afraid of some dead bugs in a life or death situation.<br/><br/>This whole movie was just bad and not in a funny way. Don't watch it.</div>

-All actors looked amazing, perfect make up, hair even tho they are meant to be in harsh conditions or going through some hectic action scenes
-weak plot
target audience? No idea, new green gene generation...
-CGI was Average, dropped the ball here
please no more of this franchise<br/><br/>Give it three weeks they will remove this from cinemas, that's how s-- it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic Park- Steven Spielbergs masterpiece that still lives up to date. The Lost World:Jurassic Park- An amazing movie to continue the Jurassic era Jurassic Park 3- A controversial film that's fun to watch. Jurassic World- The perfect way to start a new trilogy and an amazing love letter to the first installment. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom- A sequel that makes the perfect set up for the finale.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion
The beginning had me thrown off it was the normal bullcrap of saving the ""creatures"" that brought down fallen kingdom. Like come on now these creatures eat humans earth was good without them. However it does slowly get better becoming a better film with tense situations amazing action and a cool theater experience. While watching it I couldn't help but think of what the director or the film said about it before it came out. He said that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were just a setup for the finale that didn't work out. When I left the theater I thought about the things I enjoyed and disliked. The main things that I really enjoyed about the film was the intense action with Chris Patt on his motorcycle and People getting eaten. Now that was basically it but the writing was ok but it just didn't fit for the finale. The movie followed an interesting plot that starts scattered but pieces together by the end. My largest complaint after the film though was how the movie seemed like it's goal was to do justice to the characters. It didn't feel like it was trying to justify the legacy of the cloned dinosaurs that started in the first film. It was focusing on its characters which is important but not what fans wanted. The movie could litterley still be a movie without the dinosaurs resulting in not doing justice to the dinosaurs and just a plot that centered on humans.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">In my opinion, the mistake lies in having to compare the last film of the saga with the first and unattainable Jurassic Park, and compare Treworrow to Spielberg<br/><br/>""Jurassic World Dominion"" is not a great movie, nor something that will go down in history like Jurassic Park. It is not a particularly bold or in-depth film in the themes, although we were pleased to see several animatronics as well as the CGI<br/><br/>It remains a good adventure film, in line with the other Jurassic World, even if in my humble opinion, the chorality of the two parallel stories is successful and certainly the old ""magical trio"" brings something more to the film than the two previous films<br/><br/>It is not a hair-pulling film, but certainly a good film, with excellent rhythm, good narrative arc and nostalgic at the right point, without forcibly leveraging the past and giving everyone functional roles to the story<br/><br/>Although the main role is entrusted to the new characters, it would be wrong to say that the old ones have been reinserted just for ""fanservice"", their story is still dealt with in a worthy way and well interpreted<br/><br/>Beyond some scientific forcings, however present throughout the franchise which, however, does not want to represent the pure dinosaurs but admittedly allows some legitimate licenses, the film is of a good standard, and indeed has the merit of including other different species of dinosaurs, with scientific accuracy, demonstrating how scientific knowledge has evolved<br/><br/>The film turned out to be pleasant and I give it, on a scale of 1 out of 10, a good 7, like the first Jurassic World, to which a nice + must be added, thanks to the presence of the performer Jeff Goldblum, the exceptional Laura Dern and the stainless Sam Neill<br/><br/>So the film is more than good for me, I place it only behind the first two of Spielberg and a little above the first Jurassic World<br/><br/>I do not agree with the reviews that even, at the moment, give it to the last place of the new trilogy (even if it is still early)<br/><br/>Something revolutionary or equal to the first film could not be expected<br/><br/>So it deserves to be seen without the sometimes stereotyped prejudices, of some criticism.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Two Thumbs Down!<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion is a major disappointment. Nice Nostalgia, but cringy dialogue, sloppy writing, and overall bad direction lead to a poor, typical, modern day popcorn flick with little to no redeeming or memorable qualities. Most of all, Why is the soundtrack so mediocre? There are Lots of cute baby animatronics throughout the film however. Regardless the movie can't be saved from how awful the pace is and especially can't be saved from how cluttered it can be. So many events are taking place with lots of dinosaurs, but ultimately there is no value. The dinosaurs can't be saved from bad CGI and their spectacle has overstayed its welcome. Please give the franchise over to someone more experienced who believes in less is more.<br/><br/>When can Denis Villeneuve remake the original?<br/><br/>This modern franchise has gone extinct.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>No triumphant Spinosaurus return :( or any other somewhat interesting characters return like Nick Van Owen, Sarah Harding, or Tim and Lex. Major missed opportunity to not have the Kayla character be an adult Kelly. I wish an extended version of the prologue had been added to the beginning of this film as well. And all of these ideas yet they won't add more Aquatic Dinosaurs or Any Ice Age animals. I want to see a Plesiosaur and a Saber Tooth Tiger, not a stupid human clone.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Even though this movie has an amazing cast consisting of a few legacy characters and, in my opinion, beautifully done visual effects, this movie did not feel very Jurassic for at least 60% of the movie, and that's saying something. Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum all return from the original Jurassic Park to help take down Biosyn Genetics, who have begun to engineer giant crop-eating locusts to take control of the world's food supply. And while I enjoy getting more insight on InGen's biggest corporate rival, the overall effect it had at the end of the movie didn't really pay off. We didn't see many dinosaurs in this movie compared to the amount of them we saw in previous films, and that really disappointed me considering this movie is literally called ""JURASSIC World"". And while the scenes in Malta and the last 20 minutes were action packed and thrilling, it would've been better to see more dinosaurs interact with the main cast throughout the movie. But WOW, did this movie really deliver on its visuals. The scene where Owen is being chased by raptors on the bike was filmed in an amazing way. And that one scene where Claire was forced to hide from that big-ass dinosaur under the lake gave me anxiety. Overall, this movie may have had a nostalgic cast and amazing visuals, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this movie felt less Jurassic in every way possible. 7/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">My review:<br/><br/>TLDR: this sucks. Stick to the original three Jurassic Park movies as well as the show Camp Cretaceous if you want to get any enjoyment out of the franchise.<br/><br/>Full review: the reason why it's a 2/10 is the below list.<br/><br/>1. Abandoning the prologue released on YouTube showing them as animals in favor of ""look these are evil monsters"".<br/><br/>2. Owen not getting hypothermia or even reacting AT ALL to the freezing water when he fell in under the ice.<br/><br/>3. The raptor not catching Claire as she runs away but it can keep pace with a motorcycle and truck.<br/><br/>4. The claw dinosaur just watching Claire crawl into the water and then search and yell at her because COOL VISUAL instead of actual writing.<br/><br/>5. It was like the writers had someone describe Ian Malcolm to them by someone who was drunk at a party. And Sattler was purple haired Star Wars woman instead of THE Dr Sattler.<br/><br/>6. Evil people wear dark clothes and good people wear light clothes.<br/><br/>7. It was all over the place. It couldn't decide if it was mission impossible, Star Wars, a marvel action movie, fast and furious, or the notebook.<br/><br/>8. They seemingly wanted a PG rating with the fact that there's less gore than season ONE of Camp Cretaceous.<br/><br/>9. Soyjack Tim Cook as the villain. He was all over the place. In one scene he's cool calculated villain talking about his plans and another he's throwing a temper tantrum.<br/><br/>10. The narrative of ""Biosyn"" (with sin in the name) being the bad guys cuz private entity bad but governments good and totally will do the right thing.<br/><br/>This one was the epitome of the director, writers, and crew simply ""not getting it"" in terms of why the first movie was such a hit. It's a shame that this is they way Universal closes the book on the original three characters. Fans should stick with the original three movies and Camp Cretaceous.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Unless you have kids that love dinosaurs and would love to see them on the big screen you can wait to see this on your TV. The special effects are great, so there's that.<br/><br/>But overall the new Jurassic World Dominion movie is a bomb. As in not a good one. Dumb plot, ridiculous premises and same ol' same ol' stuff. The idea that these creatures and people would live together in cities is off the charts. One scene shows kids at the park with ducks and little dino's running around. What do they think dinosaurs eat? Another scene has the Pyro Raptor living in a frozen cold climate. Not a place a cold blooded reptile would be.<br/><br/>In the end there's not enough Chris Pratt and Jeff Goldblum and too much Sam Neill and Laura Dern. All chasing after a cute (Isabella Sermon) but unlikable girl who was kidnapped for some other ridiculously 'out there' reason. Truthfully I fell asleep in the middle. Keep your money in your pocket.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World Dominion a fitting end to a epic trilogy of jurassic sized movies, almost a avengers style sized movie that brings the new trio and old trio together in an attempt to save humanity on the brink of extinction.<br/><br/>Upon reading reviews and reports I was sceptical about going to see this expecting dissatisfaction and disappointment and but got a rollercoaster end to a epic movie franchise. I won't be relying on movie reviews to see future cinema movies.<br/><br/>Thrillingly exciting with epic turns and twists at every turn. A final curtain call on the jurassic era of cinema films. A must see movie to end the journey.... #excitingmovie excitingmovie<br/><br/>7/10 stars<br/><br/>#jurassicworlddominion2022 #moviereviews #moviereviewsblog #moviereviewer #SpoilerFreeReview.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I really enjoyed this film. It gives you exactly what you'd want from a Jurassic Park sequel. Yes parts were slow and the editing felt a little strange in my opinion but overall I found this very enjoyable. Bryce Dallas Howard in particular was particularly impressive - she's a fantastic actor and elevated the scenes. It was great to have the original cast too. Worth watching!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Not quite sure what people are expecting when they go see a movie about dinosaurs running wild in the real world. I've loved this franchise since I saw the original at 10 years old and being able to take my son to his first movie might make me a little biased, but I loved it more than him. That has everything you want in a summer block buster. Great set pieces, mediocre acting, and dinosaurs fighting each other. Of course it's stupid. Of course it's campy. Of course it's cheesy. Have you not seen any of the other ones for the past 30 years?<br/><br/>I made the mistake of looking at the reviews before hand and thought I was going to be wasting 2 hours. Not only would I have loved it solo, but I made a core memory for me and my kid. I'm sure if I spent hours afterwards analyzing the plot and the character arcs I would feel the same way, but I don't do that with movies starring Chris Pratt. If you like dinosaurs or any of the Jurassic Parks/Worlds, see this. There are a few throwback jokes to the original which make it all worth it for the old crowd and my five-year-old was at the edge of his seat the whole time - probably because he had to pee, but more likely because of the Giganotosaurus and Quetzalcoatlus. See the movie. Enjoy yourself. And for 2 1/2 hours try not to think about the chaos that we are actually living in.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I took my 7 Year old, dinosaur and Jurassic World mad son to see this and we both loved it..<br/><br/>It had a good story lines that brings the old films and new films together well, with nods to the original Jurassic Park it was great to have the full casts of both films together, very nostalgic. Add in the Dinosaurs, action scenes and new characters, it all made a good, easy watch that was most enjoyable.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I went to IMAX with large family to see this movie. Besides movie being such a disappointment, I noticed this movie was pushing communist agenda by showing an inflated map of China. Such a shameful kissa** attitude of the writers, directors for movie that should be not involved in such controversy. The scene where they show command center shows China's map that grabs other countries boundaries. Shame on you UNIVERSAL, shame on you JURASSIC World. You are dead to me!!!!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It wasn't amazing but it was alright and a lot of fun. Solid 7/10 for this movie I enjoyed watching it but the plot felt a little messy and predictable. I felt the writing was kind of lazy but it was still a good way to wrap up the Jurassic trilogy. It was fun to see some of the old characters return for the last time, and I enjoyed some of the action sequences like the motorcycle chase and when Claire was in that jungle. Definitely better than fallen kingdom but the original Jurassic World is still the best of the 3.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Look. It was a movie with dinosaurs and therefor cool action scenes so I ain't gonna talk bad of it really. And you know what yeah there was compelling storytelling for me too. I really wanted the girl to be safe. The giga dinosaur whatever that was didn't get the spotlight in the way I would expect given this franchises effort to put Indominous-Rex, Spinosaurus and T-Rex in it whenever they appeared. And it died to a thing with claws so what on earth I dunno. But hey. Happily ever after. Give it 15 years for the dust to settle and new CGI techniques to come out and I'm excited for the new trilogy ""Jurassic Kingdom"" or something along those lines!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I dont agree with so much of negativity about the movie. It definitely dont deserve 6 rating, the movie has a lot of exciting sequence that one would expect from this franchise. Although, it takes good 15-20 mins to get the grip but it doesnt disappoint after that. It has so much of action, edge of the seat thrill, survival scenes around lots of dinosaurs.<br/><br/>VFX is great, background score is what you need and fast paced action. It definitely worth a watch in cinema and trust me, you'll come out having enjoyed this.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Another sequel wasn't really needed and it slightly took a different direction of what we may have expected from the ending of JW2. It feels a bit like JW 2.5. It was almost same formula as always. A dinosaur park getting out of control. Though beside the usual formula, some ideas were interesting though. Especially the coexist part and dinos getting out of hand, which I would have loved to see more of and of a more bigger and threatening scale. The movie took a while to get interesting, as the beginning and it's character acting was weak. It was a bit all over the place too with it's scale and story and took a bit to actually intertwine. But when it finally set together, it was starting to get quite interesting with the usual good dino action. Seeing the old cast was nice and actually made the movie better than it would have been. A nice treat for the old fans. Some plot parts may have been a silly again and the combined generations may feel a little weird too at times. But it still was entertaining, as we got usual jokes and references every now and then. Effects were quite good and the subtle use of the main theme was nice too. I wish the threat on the world scale would have been better, as it was quite interesting to see how things go when dinos taking back the land and go into human territory. Maybe in a possible future movie, who knows. Hollywood tends to do many sequels of old movies after all. While the movie was not that much needed, it was still nice and worth a watch. Be it as a fan or maybe even as a newcomer.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">This movie could have been so much more, but instead we get a boring and uninspired movie with big crickets and Jeff Goldblum. Outside of a few scenes, It doesn't even try to show us the impact of dinosaurs living with humans. It's trying to be way to clever that it needs to be, overall a disappointing, but not terrible movie. There is some fun to be had, but thats far and in between.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Simply, a very poor script with very poor acting, the storyline is a mess and the film overall would bore a 5 year old. Aside from pretty impressive graphics, the overall theater experience was impressive specially if you go with the I-Max Option, it was a disappointment honestly.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I completely understand why this is getting bad reviews from a critical standpoint. But tbh, I loved this movie. It was everything I want in a summer blockbuster. Non-stop action, thrill after thrill, incredible visual effects. Sure a lot of the plot was silly and it was very predictable, but the movie was still super fun to watch!</div>

</div>
<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Jurassic World Dominion currently sits at just a 38% on Rotten Tomatoes and it prompted me to do my first movie review. I wondered to myself why so often do critics get it wrong? I'm not alone in this thought because here are the stats from critic's vs audience. I see this so often and I had to ask myself why is this? I think the honest answer is that critics are there because they must be, and audiences are there because they want to be. As the movie starts and the Universal logo rolled into place, I was brought back to my thirteen-year-old self. Jurassic Park came out June 9th, 1993. Twenty-nine years ago. It honestly changed movies forever for me. I have seen every Jurassic Park movie, and Jurassic World movie in the theatre. I remember a group of us going from prom to see the midnight showing of the Lost World when it came out dressed in full tux and gowns. That is fan dedication! So, to get into the Jurassic World Dominion, it is everything it should be, but not everything it could be. The film is a little long at 2 hours and 26 minutes, but it does go by quick. Colin Trevorrow sits in the director's chair again as he did in the Jurassic World (2015). As an artist I am always curious as to who the films cinematographer is? In this case, it was John Schwartzman. The film is stunning. The visuals and dinosaur effects are awesome. I appreciated the return to a lot of the practical dinosaur effects. The plot has everything a good dinosaur plot should have and a little bit more. No spoilers, but this is a straight up dinosaur James Bond movie. Personally, I love James Bond, but that was a point of contention for the critics. DeWanda Wise was a scene stealer as the dubbed Han Solo of Jurassic Park. She calls out another character in the film named Denise who your led to believe was a girlfriend? I am not sure if she is the first LGBTQ+ character in the franchise, but regardless she's great. It is also great to see all the legacy cast return. Laura Dern, Sam Neil, and of course Jeff Goldblum. The cast does become a bit of a scooby gang, and never quite feel like anything bad is going to happen to them. Alright, on to the big bad. Giganotosaurus. Well, he's bad but unintentionally gets upstaged by the Therizinosaurus (had to look that up twice) a terrifying Freddy Kruger like dinosaur. There is scene where it stalks Bryce Dallas Howard's (Claire) into a lake, and it is truly the stuff nightmares are made of. We also finally get to see the return of the dilophosaurus. The film is at its best mid-way through when a chase scene filmed in Malta breaks out. It was a real seat clencher. So, to land this review home I am going to bring it back to it was everything it should be, but not everything it could be. As far as where it lays in the franchise, I would say it falls nicely into third place behind Jurassic Park, and Jurassic World.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie doesn't feel like it deserved its existence. The old characters from jurassic Park are there just for nostalgic factor and don't feel like they belong in the story. Dialouges were cringeworthy. Most of the action scenes were fun but dumb. Seeing two dinosaurs fight each other is always exciting but they don't feel like a spontaneous force of nature rather forced. The movie will be perfect for something in the background but don't deserve your full attention.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World Dominion is fun, energetic, and most importantly compelling. Colin Trevorrow is able to deliver on all the promises made in Fallen Kingdom. The visuals are STUNNING, the action sequences are intense, and theres some really suspenful moments that take you back to the original Jurassic Park. This is without a doubt the best written movie since the original, with great dialogue throughout. Claire, Maise, Owen, and Dr. Grant are all at their best in this movie. Dominion takes a good look a humanity, and poses the question ""what would we do with unlimited genetic capabilities?"" While it does take a little bit of time to get to the action, once it gets going, the movie is amazing. Definately the best Jurassic movie since 1993, and the definition of a summer blockbuster.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">How could they get this so wrong? How could this be the worst movie out of 6 in the Jurassic park universe? I'm not even sure there is an explanation for how bad this movie is. Maybe it's the terribly corny acting, maybe it's the B movie graphics or maybe it's the totally unbelievable story arc. I say it hit all 3 of those points head on, thus my 3 star rating. What a let down for a long time Jurassic fan....</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Though many people say this movie was not very good, I say they're all lost in the metaphorical space! Whaddya mean 3/10 stars? I give this movie (as Jeff Goldblum would say) 10 out of a possible 10 Goldblums! It was so great to have the original cast back in action, and to FINALLY have Alan and Ellie end up together was so so cool. JEFF GOLDBLUM of course was incredibly funny and also incredibly inspirational in his speeches and advice. I think this movie was also a good conclusion to his character's whole story arch, because Ian Malcolm is REAL hero of the Jurassic movies, and this movie finally showed him really BEING one and saving everybody from the dinosaur. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were very good, and very nice to see them take on the roles of parents to Isabella Sermon's character. DeWanda Wise was very good, yet her character seemed sort of...extra? Not in a bad way though, Wise have a great performance and she should be applauded, and so should the rest of the cast AND their incredible director Colin Trevorrow! All in all a really awesome action-packed movie (yet not an overwhelming amount of action) with plenty of references to the original Jurassic Park (1993) that make it just so much fun for those who have seen the previous movies. Incredible job guys, and the Jurassic franchise will be missed yet loved forever!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Listen, this is a generational movie meant to entertain everyone that has seen all the movies. My husband and my kids were excited to see it. When we went to the movies, we saw grandparents, parents and kids all together. It's a fun movie for the Dino lovers to see dinosaurs in action. My 12 year old still loves dinosaurs. This movie is an opportunity to get the whole family together and enjoy a movie filled with action, some funny scenes and some scary scenes. Trust me, as a Mom and movie junkie.... This movie will be worth your money, time, the drink and popcorn!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Yes, there was SO much room to explore dinosaurs in our environment and we end up in a confined space again. However I would question how else they might tie in old and new characters.<br/><br/>Face value- seeing new dinosaurs (and how they looked) was thrilling! I especially enjoyed how they went back to ""real"" dinosaurs vs the hybrid terrors in the last two films (I loved those too). Plus, they even began including dinosaurs as we believe them to be today, feathers and all. That's sweet.<br/><br/>I don't have time or interest to spend much time critiquing details in movies (I tend to love many movies that others tear down and hate some that others adore... everyone can have an opinion). Instead, I will see this movie for what it is, a movie about dinosaurs and people attempting to survive with great visuals, awesome scenes, and great characters that I've always loved.<br/><br/>Maybe a few more deaths though could have added to the intensity of JW.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">What's with T Rex? Is he a guest professor at this place, trying to fumble through English but it all coming out as roaring? Buddy, they're standing right there! Just pick one of them and eat! This was the worst scene I've ever seen in any movie, and I sat through all of Mission to Mars (2000), so that's saying something.<br/><br/>The fights between the dinosaurs were even worse. They just stand around roaring at each other. They could have put sensors on cockfighting roosters, and used that data to make some incredible fight scenes; instead the audience is served fight scenes of total banality.<br/><br/>And the plot makes no sense. What does getting DNA samples of an insect at a sanctuary prove? This place literally captures and researches genetically resurrected organisms - it'd be strange if they *didn't* have samples of the insects.<br/><br/>And lastly, why are characters where they are in the scenes they are? Why did you not leave when everyone else left? Are you that dumb, or was something important keeping you there?<br/><br/>The movie started out with such promise; in the first couple of scenes, I thought it would be an epic commentary on the environment and genetic engineering, coronavirus, etc, and it slowly devolved from there.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Now, hear me out. I am a HUGE Jurassic Park-World fan, I have seen the movies dozen of times each, I absolutely enjoy them and it doesn't get boring to me. I actually really enjoyed this movie too, and there are some things to note:<br/><br/><ul><li>it has so many reference scenes to all the movies, so many! It becomes a sort of game, thinking, remembering and trying to figure out if the scene is somewhat similar to any of all the other movies (I counted at least 1 scene per movie, but there could easily be more).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>seeing the most important characters of ALL of the movies here was something else! A nice way to say goodbye to the saga, if you ask me.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>it has a lot of action, as expected, and it kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time. I kept jumping, covering my face, and just being fully there, which goes to show how much of a fan I am (all the friends I went with have not seen all the other Jurassic World movies (just the first Jurassic Park ones) so there's a lot they didn't understand)</li></ul><br/><br/>With this said, I have seen many amazing (8 or 9 star rated) movies from a technical standpoint, and this movie might just not qualify to be on that list. As a fan? LOVED it, but realistically people will argue it's the same old thing: same old storyline and no development of it, same plot twists as per usual.<br/><br/>So here's my final thought: I love it, I am already planning on going to watch it a second and maybe third time, because as a fan, I just want to say goodbye to my favourite characters and enjoy the end of an era.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Not a bad film. Good cinematography takes us through an action packed adventure. Some lines are cheesy, expected as this is a commercial family film. I enjoyed this much more than Jurassic world 2, I found the story to be far more engaging and old characters sure spiced it up. Undeniably though the plot was too scripted, at times you would just wait for the good guys to triumph as it is impossible for them to lose, a sense of risk or realism would have helped to keep the audience on their toes.<br/><br/>Not a bad watch at all, 7/10.</div>

So here is my spoiler free review.<br/><br/>Not bad but not excellent.<br/><br/>Flawed in places and it's too long.<br/><br/>There are parts where it gets a little dull but then it soon picks back up.<br/><br/>Good points
It ties up loose ends and has a perfect ending.<br/><br/>Also there are nice nods to the other movies that came before it.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an entertaining movie with a kinda generic plot but stunning visuals and the old gangs back.<br/><br/>So what's to complain about. I wouldn't say it's the best film ever made but it kept me on the edge of my seat and entertained.<br/><br/>I would 100% recommend it.<br/><br/>Go watch it and you won't be disappointed.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">After seeing the pitiful reviews and absolutely awful critic reviews, I doubted that this movie would be enjoyable in the least, but after seeing it, it was much more enjoyable, at least in my own opinion, than the reviews make it out to me. As someone who isn't completely obsessed with the Jurassic Park series, I was not paying too much attention for what it could have done after the expansion of opportunities, which it missed in Fallen Kingdom with the world of dinosaurs, but what the movie offered on its own. I think the plot line was fantastic, even if seemingly overused, it was done correctly. The direction at the beginning of the movie seemed confusing, but it made those connections more understandable by the end of the movie. The return of characters from JP1 was done quite fantastically, with all actors having the same feel and personality as in JP1. Jeff Goldblum was especially great in his return as Dr. Ian Malcolm, with his role in the plot making sense and with some great ad libs. The audio design was fantastic, with the surrounding environment being perfectly balanced, making you feel more interested and on your toes in scenes. John Williams did a fantastic job with the music, with new music making scenes more thrilling, as well as imputing the original theme correctly and in tone with the scenes. But the movie was not perfect on all fronts. The villain of Dr. Lewis Dodgson felt undeveloped and just cruel at times, even with the development in Fallen Kingdom. There are some areas that feel skipped over and other that feel overdone, such as the lack of comedy for most of the film, and too much comedy in certain parts. Some scenes were made too serious and others not serious enough. The film lacked balance at some points, but the movie did not disappoint as much as I feel the reviews might say. Its not perfect, but it is worth a rewatch or two once it releases on streaming services.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've adored the Jurassic movies from the very beginning. Remember seeing Jurassic Park as a young child and the feeling it gave me. Jurassic Park 2 was acceptable, the third it's best not to mention.<br/><br/>But then came the Jurassic World era. I was cautious going in to watch Jurassic World Dominion today as I made the mistake of reading some reviews. But I told myself I'll make my own mind up. I've just come out of the cinema with the biggest smile on my face. There was none stop action, a great story and quite frankly I believe my favourite of the Jurassic World movies! I just didn't want it to end. Yes, the run time is over 2 hours, but it sucked me in so perfectly I wanted more! I'm sad that this is the end of the Jurassic franchise. I just can't wait for Dominion to be released digitally so I can enjoy it again from the comfort of my home.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I have been a fan of this series since the first trailer for the original jurassic park came out. So every sequel I have expected certain things or the story to explain more in the past park and characters. This film delivered on some of them but opened more questions. As an adult I wished the film was longer and certain things could be explained more but it felt like the studio made the director cut alot out for timing purposes to get more showing in the theatre. However this is still a good movie and I am lucky to have been a child when the first one game out and now being a father watched this with my two sons. They loved this movie saying it was the best. They loved the Dino action, they loved all the character returning and they wanted more and hoping for more jurassic films. This is a Dino movie and children love them. Ignore what the critics are saying and if you've got kids, go and see this movie. It's enjoyable and worth a watch.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'd give it an 8.5
Its got flaws of course, but the film is amazing. Beautiful landscapes and sceneries, very good use of CGI and animatronics.<br/><br/>Original even, even if many didn't appreciate the new plot and ideas, I did very much. It's more in line with what Michael Crichton wrote in the first few pages of his novel, Jurassic Park.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">And that is a story.<br/><br/>They either have no plot or they have multiple plots that aren't going anywhere.<br/><br/>They either have no character developement or they have characters with multiple personalities.<br/><br/>I was this film and all the time I was thinking: what kind of a story are they trying to pull off here?<br/><br/>I just gave up midway and I was trying to enjoy this film but man, did they make an effort of spoiling that.<br/><br/>A villain so awkward to look at that I was actually hoping Ramsay would be the plot twist villain. But nope...
Locusts on fire that looks like a few dozen that escape sufdenly seeming to be in more of a hundreds causing a wildfire. And despite being a huge sanctuary they just happen to land where the heroes are. How inconvenient.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt kept looking throughout this entire film like he wanted this film to be over with real soon, like yesterday.<br/><br/>And the stars of the film, the dinosaurs. On occasions they looked stunning. Other times I was thinking I was watching the real life Flintstones or an episode of Dinosaurs. I thought Earl Sinclair would make an appaerance. It would've been funny tough.<br/><br/>But some dinosaurs looked terrible. In the end shot where the Dilophosaurus are at the Hyperloop and their fan was open, one of them looked like it was a broken umbrella. Not to mention some atrocities at the dinosaur market.<br/><br/>Thank God for Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill to save this movie with their acting. You can see they had a blast together and that is the only Deze In this is worth a 6. If it wasn't for them it was a weak 2.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I seriously don't understand why the critics and reviews are just so bad about the movie for me this movie was a great one ,it had action, adventure,suspense and left me emotional at the end because it was the end of a really great series. I watched the movie last night and we all enjoyed it it was not a boring one, even my mom who don't have any interest in Hollywood movies enjoyed it .i recommend you to go and watch it and i will never ever suggest you to focus more on review or critics if you like watching these kind of movies and do like the series, just go and watch it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Personally I think that they could've have added way more dinosaurs in the first hour-ish of the film and it was a bad beginning In my opinion. The plot continued and slowly got better and my rating kept going up from a 5 as the movie progressed. By the end of the movie, I didn't regret my decision of watching it and I enjoyed it as a movie but not a Jurassic World movie. It was predictable and cringey at parts, but again that's what happens with kids movies nowadays. The casting was good and the characters were played well but I personally would've liked a better plot line and more dinosaurs.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was great to see some familiar faces that spanned much of the franchise together in one scene. The climactic and expected battle was decent enough, yet it seemed to borrow heavily from other films in the series. The cast did good with what they were given to work with. The Dino action was great, but not as frequent. Some of the dialogue was cringy. There were a lot of cool nods to other iconic moments in the franchise.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">In many ways it seems it tried to do what Top Gun Maverick has done with bringing back characters from long ago. Unfortunately it felt like the magic is lost a little whereas in top gun the vibrancy is still present. The re introduced actors from the original Jurassic parks do not have the same synergy they once did.<br/><br/>Otherwise it stuck with the basic Jurassic World chase scenes and had some scenes that were entertaining .<br/><br/>If you go into this movie with high expectations you might be let down, but when you go in only hoping for a generally simplistic plot and maybe a few neat looks of the new the dinosaurs created then you're more likely to enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>Lastly, the ending seemed to be too hard to believe with animals living in harmony alongside dinosaurs that were once their prey. There was no explanation of how this happened really either, certainly felt rushed at the end.</div>

BDH and Chris Pratt play stiff corpses with epic precision so they shoehorn nostalgia into every aspect of the movie in attempt to make the viewer forget the lack of a cohesive story or main characters to root for. The original gang's return is by far the high point even though they are given so little to do. Worth a watch but completely forgettable. Wait until it's available for a bargain. The movie suffers from the burden of its own length. Should have been 90 minutes.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very predictable. Felt like the producer just half assed the whole movie. Characters finding each other coincidentally, like how on earth can you find someone in an enormous sized forest after being separated FAR away. No way that is possible. You'll see a lot of things that will raise questions and have you feeling like, ""yeah this movie is garbage"". On the bright side, you'll see all of the characters from the other Jurassic movies. Still 1/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I was very sceptical about another Jurassic Park film but excited at the same time.... After a slow start to the movie the story line really begins to take shape. With the reuniting of original Jurassic Park characters and new Jurassic World characters, it is the perfect blend.<br/><br/>There is excitement and suspense from the start, it really will not disappoint!!! A perfect end to a phenomenal movie franchise!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Definitely not a good movie. Also definitely not the worse movie I've ever seen. There small moments I enjoyed and hey I love dinosaurs so I was always gonna see it. That's about all the positives I can say. Acting was very spotty plot was all over the place and overall not great. Some seriously laughable action scenes that felt like the director was 13 years old or something. Some of the cgi was decent and some of it was absolutely awful. More of a weekend TV movie then something you spend money on. There is specifically a part where the allosaurus was after them and it was one of the worst action scenes I've ever seen and especially the worst in Jurassic park.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I haven't liked a single one of the jurassic park movies, found them boring and pointless. But this one I loved, I could tell they actually wanted to make this. Just the fact they got the original trio was fantastic! Jeff Goldblum was the funniest he could be! The only thing I didn't like that the child was a little annoying. I a little bit cringed at the beginning but in the end I loved all the characters in this! Definitely give this a watch anytime you can!!!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was very brave. It definatly the best it could have been with a few major decisions needing to be made. Although it was not the best it is still worth a watch and probably doesnt deserve this much hate. It would be much better if it were a longer movie as everything felt squeezed. Still a worth wrap up for this era in the franchise.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I'm so glad that this was a well put together film. It was beautifully shot, decently paced, and had a good balance of story, character focus, and, of course, action. It felt like Jurassic Park meets Bourne Identity, with a twist of Indiana Jones and even a bit Star Warsy at times. Like a Star Wars level of world immersion, where they took us away and we experienced a new world where dinosaurs were now integrated into some parts of society. The scene in Malta was totally comparable to a Star Wars Cantina scene.<br/><br/>The aesthetic and cinematography of Dominion made me more nostalgic than seeing the original cast. The shots were a little more hard lit and gritty than what we're used to, versus the overly HDR hyperreal, super clean visuals we expect to see in most blockbuster movies. Dominion felt a lot more grounded and classically cinematic. Back and side lighting for the win.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the focus and interactions between the large cast of characters, both old, older and new. It didn't feel like anyone overly dominated the screen, with everyone sharing a place, a purpose and a voice before finally uniting for a fun and exciting climax. The dinosaurs also didn't overtake the story, allowing the human elements to breath, with their appearances serving as well timed spectacles that complimented the overall world and story. Visually this is the best we've seen, and I wasn't sure at times if they brought back the animatronics, or the CGI has improved a lot more for this film. I think it may have been a mix of both.<br/><br/>I really think that they went through the previous films in the series, saw what work and what didn't work, and put their efforts into not making the the same old mistakes. While simultaneously brainstorming a bucket list of new things they wanted to bring to life and create on screen. Like of course, if you have to compete with a baby Yoda it makes sense to create a baby Blue. Overall for me this was the strongest of the sequel trilogy, and a strong contender for the second best in the saga. I wouldn't be surprised if we hear another TV series announced some time soon based on this Jurassic World.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've been sitting here, trying to figure out where to even begin. I don't normally write reviews but this one really got to me. I went on opening night and purchased the collector tub and cup featuring Blue &amp; Beta. I guess I should start with the fact the I kinda feel like I got the ol' bait and switch. Putting everyone's favorite raptors on there like they have lots of screen time when they don't. Owen and Blue's bond was barely touched on. Hell, this doesn't even feel like a Jurassic Park/World movie really. The acting was stiff, even from some of the veterans. The CGI was...off? I'm not sure how to even describe that. And there are so many holes in the plot that I got confused bc nothing really made any sense.<br/><br/>I guess I'll just start going through some of the things that didn't add up for me..
The pilot helping.. why? There was nothing remarkable about Kayla seeing Maisie during the trade off. No words spoken, not something similar happening to her or a love one, nothing. It made no sense that a pilot for hire would do anything for strangers, for free.<br/><br/>The locusts. I know the scientists stated that they were more hardy but that hardly constitutes that a swarm of locusts could survive AND FLY while burning, for the amount of time that they did. Their wings would've been the first thing to burn up but in the movie they fly around long enough to escape a building and fly around to set miles of forest ablaze. Ye...no.<br/><br/>While we're talking about burning locusts, when Malcolm threw the spear into the mouth of the Giganotosaurus and it... exploded, making him look like he could breathe fire. That's not how that works.. Just no.<br/><br/>T-Rex/Therizinosaurus vs Giganotosaurus. I think this made me the most upset. There was no explanation about the long clawed, seemingly blind dinosaur that pops up and seems intent on disemboweling everything. And the fact that it seemed to form a pact with the T-Rex makes no sense. There was no bond like with the T-Rex and Blue and the fight seemed pointless in general. And why wouldn't the Therizinosaurus not attack Rex after?<br/><br/>It's like they knew they had this super flimsy plot and decided to fill it full of JP nostalgia and lots of pointless action to keep us distracted. This wasn't a JP or JW movie, it was an action flick with dinosaurs thrown into it. So I mean, entertaining for sure but a very big flop for me.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Ignore some of the snooty, all-knowing critics! This movie is fun and meant to be seen on the big screen. The dinosaurs are amazing and the story does a great job in joining together the actors across the 5 prior movies (mostly #1 and #4) in a way that is satisfying and exciting. And loud! If you want an overly intellectual plot, go watch a Jane Eyre flic; if you want popcorn pounding fun...it's here!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">All I can say is that the plot felt like a highschool group project where the writers didn't share any notes before the big presentation.instread of a little fear and excitement all I felt was frustrated and annoyed. I wanted it to end but it just kept going and going and going...... Very sad because I was genuinely excited to see this movie. Talk about a classic cash grab based on nostalgia.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The good:
Not much to say here but nostalgia. That's what made this movie at least watchable. Reuniting the original cast plays with you no matter how hard you try. Also the dinosaur effects are always enjoyable of course but nothing new.<br/><br/>The bad:
Where do I even start? Let's begin with the weak story, which starts with a company that came virtually out of nowhere and a truly awkward villain that never gets to fully explain why he does what he does. Trying to rule the world for no apparent reason isn't just cheap but boring. Moreover, the two simultaneous stories don't seem to blend well until the very end.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the script. It's awful to say the least and full of awkward moments. So much potential having the three good old friends but somehow they messed it up. You'll find poor and empty dialogues during the whole movie and more stupid jokes than what my body can handle.<br/><br/>Jurassic Bond? At some point I thought I was looking at an international action movie. And they tried hard to do so. A scene full of action touring the most recondite cornerns of the exotic location of your choice at the purest James Bond style wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I paid the ticket.<br/><br/>The ugly:
The concept of dinosaurs being part of the modern world isn't just nonsensical but absurd. I don't know how in hell this idea crossed the door. Dinosaurs aren't pets. Period. In any scenario would anyone be ok with having their favorite hiking route full of velociraptors or buying a nice apartment knowing a pterodactylus can fly trough your balcony at any time. I know it's a movie, but this was the whole movie concept and it was just foolish.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Seriously unapologetic in my love for this movie. I was truely surprised how many negative reviews I have seen about it. It starts with the premise the dinosaurs are already out and living in society. They aren't focusing on dealing with the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs existence has been accepted and the plot moves forward into a different story line. The consequences of more genetic manipulation that has caused a different potentially cataclysmic issue.<br/><br/>In my opinion it had a great story line, I loved how the legacy cast and new cast was brought together and I thought it was done with humour and fun. The characters have developed since we last saw them and I love their relationships and their interactions with each other. I didn't feel there was any lack of dinosaurs or dinosaur battles. I'm also glad they didn't try to deal with the existence of the dinosaurs and what to do with them. They have accepted them as part of life and moved on. All in all it was a fantastic movie and one I will watch many times in the future. I'm glad Henry Wu was able to have his moment of redemption at the end. This movie had all the feels and I loved how it gave a nice happy conclusion at the end. It was well acted, kept a good pace which it needed being a longer movie and the visual effects were beautiful. Loved the sequences at the end with some scenes of modern animals racing alongside the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing! Sit back and enjoy the ride!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Following the poor directions the last movie took, this one is definitely an improvement. Obviously, the story has some faults, but this movie has a lot of what people are coming to see, dinosaurs. The re-introduction of the legacy characters was also done greatly. If you like dinosaurs and action, go see this movie and enjoy it. Don't get carried away in the critical reviews because at the end of the day, it's just a movie about 65 million year old extinct animals.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It was a decent film but not a good finale to the Jurrasic Park franchise, the movie had a bit of an underwhelming plot. The dinosaurs were pretty cool though but the dinosaur fights weren't great.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">My review of ""Jurassic World: Dominion."" It was ... okay. Not as bad as the critics say, but not a masterpiece, either. It was fun. Unlike last year's ""Ghostbusters"" where the originals got about 10 minutes of screen time. The three original JP characters were a major part of this storyline. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are still ""hot"" for 70-somethings, but Laura Dern has injected so much plastic into her face that she is absolutely unrecognizable! And while 10 or 15 years ago I would have rolled my eyes at the ""easy villain"" being Big Bio, we all know that's absolutely TRUE now. It was a nice wrap-up with a nice homage to its beginnings. But I'd either see it on your movie theatre's cheap day, like I did, or wait for it to be available for home viewing. Not sure it's worth FULL price admission.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first Jurassic Park was a magical experience that benefitted from have been made at a time prior to our over exposure to CGI. When viewers saw the first movie there was a collective gasp at the sight of the dinosaurs. That magic has long gone. With the dinosaurs having become nearly cartoon in the CGI world, there is no longer an interesting story. This last movie is just an assault on the senses by noise and action, and too many scenes which have been regurgitated from of the history of the franchise.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">They need to rethink the plot. It's so underwhelming and convoluted all at once. The whole essence of the franchise it's not up to date to the Dinosaur facts in 2022. Please update the velociraptor name to Deinonychus, Dimetrodon was not a dinosaur and was still featured (at least they should've talked about it), Therizinosaurus stabbing the Giganotosaurus was a long reach, very unrealistic....also, most Dinos should've got updated to their original feathered versions...
The hand thing is tired. Cut it out for once.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">As an avid action flick fan, I really enjoyed Dominion. But I don't understand why so many are dead set on this being the worst one of the franchise. (Come on guys, is it really worse than JP3 or Fallen Kingdom?) Most of the reviews from popular critics like to call out Dominion's length and how it ""is a soulless imitation banking on nostalgia."" However, of the six Jurassic Park movies, this is not the worst by a long shot.<br/><br/>While the length at 2 1/2 hours is a bit of a detriment, ""soulless"" is not the word I would use. Dominion pays off to many of the themes that have been set up by Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom. None of the characters are obnoxious to the point of unlikable. The cinematography and especially the sound design are very well done. The plot, though a bit chaotic, can still be followed easily enough.<br/><br/>However, the film still has its flaws. Some of the side plots don't get enough attention, and the villain is a little sub-par. The second half follows the humans a lot more than the dinosaurs, and that could be a turn off for fans of the franchise. The aforementioned length does make it difficult for those with short attention spans to sit through. By the 2/3rd point I was staring to notice it hadn't wrapped up yet, but the pacing was well done and at no point was I ever bored.<br/><br/>So why are so many big-name critics so willing to throw Dominion under the bus? I have a theory. After so many sequels that failed to capture the magic of the original, encluding Dominion, these critics take their anger of a franchise as a whole and apply it to the latest film. The problem is that the original was truly one-of-a-kind, and very few movies can hold a candle to it. It would take nothing short of a miracle to surpass the original Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>The other thing I have noticed it that there has been an increasing disconnect between critics and audiences. Many review websites, YouTube channels, and social media outlets like posting negative reviews because that's what gets the clicks. I get it; it's fun to write and to read slander about something you disagree with, but if you only focus on the bad then that is all you'll ever find.<br/><br/>Overall, by no means perfect, it is a decent and effective conclusion to the Jurassic World trilogy.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I didn't watch any reviews or trailers for this one, but I watched it with low expectations because I really didn't like the previous film. I was positively surprised! The film doesn't try to do a ""Jurassic Park"" again, but focuses on mostly chase scenes and the classic Jurassic franchise tension of ""will the dinosaurs see them"". Even though it's predictable, it's still quite effective. I think the new additions to the cast were solid, they did a great job on the worldbuilding (which is always a big plus for me) and they did a good job on bringing the teams from the Jurassic Park and World franchises together.</div>

A kid is shown in peril but the producers will never have the spine kill them off. And of course, the main cast is saved by another apex predator to fight off the main antagonist. *Yawn* The action and set pieces were cool but other than that it was a very predictable and messy film.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Firstly, I just want to say that the original Jurassic Park should have won an Oscar for best picture etc. For its time it was outstanding, and even today hold its own without much difficulty.<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion is a poor culmination of the JW franchise that initially seemed like a good addition with the first two films.<br/><br/>Dominion is such a poorly written movie with a confused plot that sadly put dinosaurs back into the ground. I am honestly shocked and saddened that Spielberg approved off this script. The story was a convoluted mess, and I left the cinema an hour ago with a sunken heart. Forced reunions, poor effects, rushed scenes, and stupid lines that almost made it feel like a really poor Bond film mixed with the most recent Fast and Furious movie.<br/><br/>The director should be tried at the Hague for crimes against humanity, for crushing the soul of Jurassic Park with what I can only describe as the worst film in the complete franchise.<br/><br/>In a world in which we have some of the greatest minds, I just can't understand why a better script wasn't written. Like the latest Rambo and Terminator, Dominion is the tombstone beneath which lies our beloved dinosaurs.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Charles Barkley would call this turrible. It is so poorly written and cheesy that it feels like a B movie made to make you laugh at its short-comings. There are a few callbacks to the original, but that's where the positives stop. The acting is bad, the plot is all over the place, the dialogue is suspect...how do movies like this keep making profit?? Are we that far gone as a species!?</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Obviously a ton of issues with the movie. None of the baddies saw Owen, Alan, or the rest of the gang on the security cameras (except Ramsey). A sustainable ecosystem with dinosaurs, where they don't instantly devour the horses and whales around them? But, it's a film series about genetically modified dinosaurs, so you're already suspending your disbelief.<br/><br/>A big highlight was seeing the original trio from the original movie. If you're looking for a fun movie with crazy visuals and a nostalgia factor, this is the one.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Absolutely brilliant film, after 20+ years since Jurassic park was released and this film was made for true fans of the Jurassic Park/World era. It had lots of nostalgic scenes which made it truly special.<br/><br/>The story line was light hearted and was a beautiful way to bring back the original cast with the newer cast.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Mixed bag of greatness and mediocre. A really enjoyable blockbuster for what it is, has some poor dialogue in some scenes and a little cheesy bits with the boss of Bryson. The cast though is excellent, cinematography is amaze balls, and there's plenty of awesome high budgeted action sequences throughout. I loved a lot of it though I must say it's great fun especially in IMAX! There was even a great Q&amp;A I got to see was silly when someone said finally when that ended I was thinking why pay for the longer version with extras if you don't want to see that aspect some don't make sense. I crave any special feature I'd work on film if I could and I'd say Jurassic World: Dominion is a worth seeing.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World Dominion capitalized on nostalgia with many familiar dinosaurs, callbacks, and the old Jurassic Park crew. However, despite the fun and exciting new characters, dinos, and stakes, there is no more room for plot. The movie lacks in an organized story and has the characters stumble into exactly what they need or what they have to do next. Ultimately, it was a thrilling but messy movie with the most interesting parts being the dinosaurs.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">As an avid fan of Jurassic and after the hype that came from the initial trailers, I was optimistic that Dominion could be the epic finale that the fans deserved. But the story seemed to be a little bit... disjointed and unnecessary.<br/><br/>For a world now plagued with these prehistoric beasts, the finished product seems like a missed opportunity and the chaos seemed minimal to say the least.<br/><br/>As far as a summer blockbuster goes, it certainly does the job - but it leaves a sour taste.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The film is a bit of a mess really. The most part is the intense and scary action sequences involving the dinos, but besides that, it's not got a good villain nor a well put together storyline. I only enjoyed the action scenes of the movie, but other than that...nothing.<br/><br/>For the JW fans that will be seeing it on opening weekend, enjoy it while you can. Because this isn't the best sequel to round off the Jurassic era.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The cinematography is there, the action sequences are there, the suspense is barely there.<br/><br/>This movie was better than the previous two but that does not necessarily make this a better movie. I was entertained yes but would I ever revisit it? Well, no. This entire new gen series lacks so much the OG had. I also agree with one of the other reviewers in saying that even the nostalgia of the OG cast was not enough to rate this movie any higher.<br/><br/>I remember even the smallest of dinosaurs being a threat in the classics. Now apparently we can choke a grown dinosaur with our bare hands (Picture Homer choking Bart.) There are many other parts that are not 'realistic.'<br/><br/>Yes, I know this is all fiction but the classics gave us that unnerving feeling is being stuck in the wrong territory.<br/><br/>I can see this movie having mixed reactions from audiences and if you enjoyed the previous 2, then you will have a blast with this.<br/><br/>If you a huge Jurassic Park fan go watch it.. but doubt you would ever watch it again..<br/><br/>(Also Julianne Moore deserves being part of the OG cast)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Plot and storytelling is all over the place. Story isn't about living amongst dinosaurs, it's about the cohabitation of characters new and old. Same caricature of an ol weak villain from Jurassic World 1 and 2. Very stale concept: dinosaurs are deadly, they're bigger, and evil corporation wants to exploit them.<br/><br/>Overall...45 minutes into it, we were ready to leave; didn't, because we paid money. Who do I talk to about getting a refund?</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">After the ""Battle at Big Rock"" short released in 2019, my expectations where high for an epic finale to Jurassic films. I was looking forward to seeing the chaos of Dinosaur and Humans living side by side, and which side of the philosophical debate on the dinosaurs existence would win.<br/><br/>We got none of this. For a film about Dinosaurs, they actually feature very little in the plot. The plot was basic at best - biosyn creating havoc through genetic manipulation (sound familiar), and even then it wasn't about Dinosaurs, but Locusts from the Cretaceous period, with a few dinosaur chase thrown in for good measure . Big disappointment.<br/><br/>Many of the action scenes were rehashes of previous scenes in the original movies - just shorter and not as good. It wasn't edge of your seat terrifying, it didn't make you jump - it felt like a bit of a let down.<br/><br/>The only saving grace was the actors. They played their parts excellently. But the story was a big disappointment.<br/><br/>A sad end to my favourite film franchise.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Novelty, action adventure, and monster horror are what made the original Jurassic Park amazing. Jurassic World: Dominion checks the action adventure box. At times, the monster horror box. But, it always falls short on novelty.<br/><br/>You can't be surprised by this. After all this is the 6th installment of the series. Novelty left the building awhile ago.<br/><br/>The Jurassic series chief conflict has always been man's desire to control nature, and despite the warnings of Jeff Goldblum we attempt it time and time again. Jurassic World: Dominion attempts to wrap up this conflict, and it does, albeit it in an unsatisfying way.<br/><br/>There are three groups we follow through out the film. Each pursuing their own goals until they eventually converge. One of these story lines is good. The other two seem like filler with even one of them not having any real tangible effect.<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion try's. It try's really freaking hard. And when it hits it hits right. Those moments are just so few and far between. Honestly, if you take away the star power of Chris Pratt, Jeff Goldblum, and the call back cast from the original. It comes off like an early 2000's sequel that should have gone straight to dvd.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a terrible movie. But I do think it falls short of even being a good film. If you like the new Jurassic World movies you'll like this as well. If not, we'll at least the dinosaurs look pretty.<br/><br/>Oh, and there is an evil version of Tim Cook.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">If you like recalling your knowledge of dinosaur names with characters on the big screen then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>This movie has more dinosaurs than Taylor Swift has songs about ex-boyfriends. Also, the amount of dinosaur character development was off the charts. It's about time we get to know why the T-Rex is so angry.<br/><br/>There is dinosaur violence. There are old dinosaur grudges that end in epic dinosaurs battles...(#GodzillaVibes). There are promises kept to dinosaurs and moments of sweet dinosaur gratitude. And...I'm pretty sure that gigantosaurus represented toxic masculinity.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a very dinosaur-positive movie. I personally would have loved to see more screen time with dinosaurs covered in feathers but you can't always get what you want. 7/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I went in hoping dearly for a perfect conclusion to the Jurassic franchise. The original Jurassic Park is one of my absolute favorite movies that I have seen so many times that I have it pretty much memorized. It was so far ahead of its time and still lives up to today. It is such an amazing classic. And this 'finale' didn't do it justice.<br/><br/>But it wasn't horrible either. It was decent enough to still have me waiting to see what comes next. There were plenty of moment that were cringe. The story wasn't written very well. A lot of it was predictable. And too much reliance on nostalgia. Although I loved seeing Dr. Grant and my dear Dr. Sattler welcomed back to the Jurassic franchise, their roles in this movie didn't do their characters justice either. Still there were a few parts I did enjoy and I didn't necessarily hate anything. It just isn't very rewatchable and a lot of parts were unnecessary.<br/><br/>Also I was mainly excited to see Blue and her baby but there just wasn't enough of them which left me disappointed. I did like that they explored Maisie's character a bit more but she honestly got pretty annoying at times. It mostly felt like they were trying too hard to do fan service and stuffed too much of it into the movie that they neglected creating a compelling story overall.<br/><br/>I love my dinos though so I was still happy to see them again and some of the visuals were beautiful. So I am glad I saw it on the big screen instead of waiting for it to be released like some people I know plan to do. I just wish they had put more effort into the storyline. I guess like the first trilogy where I pretend the sequels don't exist, I'll have to do the same here and pretend Fallen Kingdom and Dominion don't exist so I can continue to enjoy Jurassic World which I do like even if it it doesn't match the perfection of the original Jurassic Park.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">They managed to bring back a bunch of characters and then under utilize them. Chris Pratt in particular had virtually none of his usual wit. Then they added characters that really had very little connection to the story. So basically it amounted to how many different ways can we make people run away from dinosaurs in increasing implausible ways and still tie in some nostalgia for the original Jurassic park. Add in some unscientific speeches on climate change and you've got a two and a half hour boring movie that gets two stars instead of one for the beautiful CGI.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The movie pulls you in during the first 10-15 minutes on nostalgia alone and seems to be heading towards a 6.5 rating but it falls very short after that and drops low.<br/><br/>The movie has much better action sequences than Fallen Kingdom but it's about as dumb. What keeps it from being the dumbest of the franchise is the presence of the Trinity (Alan, Ellie, and Ian...) They really make you smile because they still have chemistry.<br/><br/>The plot is all over the place. The effects are not that spectacular as they should be. The musical score is not up to par.<br/><br/>The body count is extremely low. Granted the movie is not about blood and guts but there wasn't any real threat in this film besides it's excessive runtime.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park has been spiraling ever since World Arc first started and has went from an intelligent techno-thriller into a whatchamacallit mess of mediocrity.<br/><br/>It really all depends on what you're looking for though. If you're looking for something intelligent and enough to be iconic, this is not it.<br/><br/>Also this movie, has a chick in here who is just as vile as some of the guys and she gets spared...I was hoping a raptor would take her out....<br/><br/>Owen also brings nothing to this franchise except his claim as being someone we recognize as Starlord. He even has a dumb line, ""I always come back...""<br/><br/>It has its occasional nods and nostalgia for crutches. That's all that is keeping it from toppling over into complete obscurity.<br/><br/>The way gigs died was so stupid and the Trex waking back up......🙄</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I don't know what people were expecting with this movie and why many seem to be up in arms about it. I am a big fan of the first film and saw it in theaters as a child upon its release. For many, including myself, the magic of that first movie is never going to be topped and it's impossible to think it could be.<br/><br/>That said, the second film has always been dull to me (and Jeff Goldblum seemed to be playing a different character than Ian Malcolm altogether). The third has solid moments but some silly ones as well. Jurassic World seemed to rejuvenate the franchise and was a good movie overall, but nothing mind-blowing in my opinion.<br/><br/>Then we have Fallen Kingdom, which I believe is easily the worst in the series. Strange plot, terrible pacing, weird directorial choices left and right. The main characters and their motivations seemed completely different than what you would have expected from their portrayal in Jurassic World.<br/><br/>That movie also ended with the concept of a world filled with dinosaurs - a point which people seem to be rolling their eyes about, now that Dominion has to address it.<br/><br/>This is unfair. Dominion is a movie that must take the plot threads that are limply presented in Fallen Kingdom and then spin a sequel out of them. On top of that, it must weave in the cast of the beloved first film and make a satisfying conclusion out of both stories.<br/><br/>And guess what? I think it accomplishes this, and much better than I expected it would. The movie is exciting, well-paced, well-acted, and has far fewer eyeroll moments than the critics would have you believe.<br/><br/>At this point, I think you're either along for the ride or you aren't. If you're only casually aware of Jurassic Park and you go into this movie somewhat blind, it would probably seem like a mess of convoluted plot points. But if you're coming off of Fallen Kingdom, this feels like a breath of fresh air and a fun ride.<br/><br/>I would honestly rank this movie as the second best Jurassic Park movie, behind the original. And Ian Malcolm's portrayal in this film is perfect, unlike what we got in Lost World. It's a joy to see.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved the jurassic park movies when i was a kid, and i still love them. This just feels like classic jurassic park, a lot of dinosaurs and a lot of screaming. The plot was okay, a world filled with dinosaurs and a divided opinion on if they should stay or go.<br/><br/>It's a perfect movie to not watch because i watched this with my girlfriend and it's the perfect movie to just watch with someone casually, not too crazy of a plot, scary tense moments sometimes. You could look away from the screen and still get a grasp of what's going on.<br/><br/>I would recommend, for kids and for couples. I don't know about single people though !</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I loved it. I went into the movie knowing it's not going to be the first Jurassic Park or the first Jurassic World. If you want to watch a movie that's just like the originals, then I'd suggest watching the originals again. This is a new movie that furthers the plot from the prior movies, and marries this current trilogy to the original trilogy. I does a great job - great acting, great script, great action scenes, great pacing. The movie provides compelling reasons for each of the characters to want to be involved. I loved the new additions to the cast. I have absolutely no complaints - great job, everyone.</div>

The movie is better than JW2, which doesn't say much. The plot is terrible, longer than necessary, not interesting at all, and makes JP3 a masterpiece. The t-rex was badly shown, the giganotosaurus even worse, didn't have a big entry, and for what is worse, no spinosaurus. THE EVENTS OF JP3 WERE COMPLETELY ERRADICATED!!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">So where to start, this is definitely not anywhere close to the level of the original jurassic parks, but I dont think any of us were expecting that.<br/><br/>The sets of story lines dont particularly work well together or really compliment each other and there is some truly laughable moments, also I think the ""new trio"" let's call them, have much worse chemistry than the old.<br/><br/>However that being said, to keep it short and sweet, this film has some fantastic callbacks to the originals, some interesting action scenes (although it does feel abit fast and furious at times), and I did enjoy the cinematic clips of the dinosaurs interacting with the animals we have today.<br/><br/>In conclusion, dont take the film to seriously, don't expect too much. Yes it feels a little lost and confused on what it wants to be, but its not an awful time, not a great one, not a particularly memorable one, but certainly not an awful one.<br/><br/>Worth watching for the original cast atleast, to see them one final time in characters we love.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The first 20-30 minutes of this movie is hard to believe, and I'd love for the main 'Dinosaurs-accepted-as-living-alongside-people' subplot really should have been left on the cutting room floor, full stop &amp; completely. It's totally absurd, in no world would people just deal with it and look the other way, literally no one would tolerate raptors on the loose... and in this movie, everyday people don't run and scream in horror for some reason, they hang about until they get eaten, seemingly with little knowledge of their two giant carnivores in broad daylight, or breaking out of a cage in the background... Dumb.<br/><br/>That craziness aside, the movie picks up soon after, with more fun dinos and much better CG some of the new species (another issue with the early parts of the movie.) All of the current and past characters enjoy some good suspense or action. Dinos are best in dark, confined areas, with their threat taken seriously... which luckily the rest of the movie provides.<br/><br/>All-in-all it's a worthy film. I went in with the assumption that I wouldn't be getting some perfect conclusion, and there are probably too many characters in play, but it was enjoyable.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Jurassic World Dominion is the 6th and final entry in the Jurassic saga and with that comes high expectations for this film, While it manages to be highly entertaining with intense moments, the majority of the film fails to capture the Jurassic feel, cramming too much into its First act. The OG's returning ultimately don't add much to the story because ""Hey I remember them"". And Fan service moments (That I loved). Although the final act of the film is an absolute thrill. It feels unearned due to the boring first act. As much as I wanted to love this unfortunately this final entry into the Jurassic franchise leaves me just barely satisfied with a 8/10.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I genuinely believe that if you switched the casts of this movie with the recent casts of Fast and Furious, it would make equally as much sense and the movie wouldn't change a bit.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt (Owen) is Vin Diesel (Dom) because obviously. Jeff Goldblum (Malcolm) is Tyrese (Roman) because he's witty and hilarious. Sam Neill (Grant) is Sung Kang (Han) because he's back for almost no reason at all. DeWanda Wise (Kayla) is Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) for the tough female support. Mamoudou Athue (Ramsay) is Ludacris (Tej) for the tech knowledge. Isabella Sermon (Maisie) is Nathalie Emmanuel (Ramsey) because they're sought after by the bad guys. BD Wong (Dr. Wu) is Kurt Russell (Mr. Nobody) because they're the intelligence ops leaders.<br/><br/>I'm sure I could keep going but you probably get the point by now. The dinosaurs were a complete subplot that existed only to serve the title of the franchise. There's no rhyme or reason to the dinosaur fight scenes for anything but fan service. However, I did still give it a five because a four felt too harsh.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honestly I am a fan of the Jurassic Park series but this movie is completely smothered in bad CGI and lazy writing. The plot is sub-par the scenes with dinosaurs were mid at best. The dinosaurs look home made and was very disappointing. They really tried to revive the movie with nostalgia by bringing back some of the original cast and adding Easter eggs referring back to the previous films. I never had high hopes for this movie and hopefully they end the Jurassic world series.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Ladies and gentlemen, it's here.<br/><br/>The finale of the entire Jurassic series has finally arrived in theatres.<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion is a fun, thrilling action adventure story with dinosaurs. This film is filled with the typical dinosaur action sequences, a couple of which can feel indicative of Jason Bourne and Indiana Jones action scenes.<br/><br/>Bringing back the original three was a stroke of genius and I appreciated how they fit them into the plot without them feeling shoehorned in.<br/><br/>Where this movie fails for me was the flimsy plot.<br/><br/>If you start to think, there are lots of coincidences and inconsistencies that push the plot forward.<br/><br/>This film is not smartly written like some blockbusters today. It is nowhere near as smart as the original film.<br/><br/>This film promised a story about dinosaurs in the real world, but instead it uses that as a catalyst for a story that has nothing to do with them being out in the real world. I feel as though this story could have been told if the cliffhanger from Fallen Kingdom never even happened.<br/><br/>Beyond that, if this film was trying to produce a satisfying conclusion to each trilogy's story it horrendously failed. If it was simply trying to get me to smile really quick at seeing the original cast again, it succeeded spectacularly.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is a one-watch scenario for me. It delivers the thrills of dinosaur action sequences and the joy of seeing my childhood heroes back on the screen. However, it did not fully deliver on the promise of a plot based around dinosaurs in the wild and it did not deliver the proper conclusion for the characters we've been following.<br/><br/>The cast ranking
Laura Dern
Sam Neill
Jeff Goldblum
DeWanda Wise
Campbell Scott
Bryce Dallas Howard
Chris Pratt
Isabella Sermon<br/><br/>Chris Pratt is my favorite actor, but I was so disappointed with how little the script gave him to work with.<br/><br/>If you're expecting a ton of dino action sequences, this is the film for you. If you're expecting a smartly written, Endgame-level conclusion to decades of story, just rewatch Endgame.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Beautiful movie! Lot of different and great scenerys. Big variety of dinosaurs that cause lot and lot of action throughout the movie (more than the rest). Excellent effects and cgi.<br/><br/>Lot of important and iconic characters, and surprisingly everyone is included and developed nicely while having important roles.<br/><br/>Even as sci-fi, there is allways a lot to learn from this movie and fantastic saga.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I am shocked the with the reviews this film is getting, which made me very sceptical before going into the theaters.<br/><br/>I love this franchise ever since day 1 with Jurassic Park back in 1993. Yes, it has had its up and downs, and will never catch the ""wow"" factor but a film that has dinosaurs is wow enough. The JW series have made significant changes in capturing that moment to put into their own mark in the franchise, which I think this chapter is the strongest and most entertaining.<br/><br/>The nostalgia aspect of the film may lead me to being a biased to why I enjoyed it as much as I did.... but everything else this movie offered was great, though at first I thoughts the pacing of the movie dragged but coming away and really thinking about the story it's just a minimal let down for me.<br/><br/>The throwbacks in these movies like to add are an amusing part of why I enjoy the JW series, and they do not disappoint in JW3.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is the best of the JW series which old and new character times being used on screen will have you enjoy every moment, that's also including the dinosaurs adding to the enjoyment. DO NOT listen to the negative comments before seeing this movie, and save the agreements or disagreement tIll after you have seen JW3.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am a massive Jurassic Park geek but enough is enough. Becoming like fast and furious movies now, just stop making them. The movie had very little dinosaur action, and focused more on the saving of a teenager and locusts. Jurassic World I loved, then they brought Fallen Kingdom which I liked but this, I didn't really understand what they were trying to achieve? Some big conclusion? Giving old characters some spot light? The actors were great, I can't fault that, and there were some entertaining moments, but the script went so far off topic, it seems they could have made the film without dinosaurs and it would have still been the same film. Disappointed is an understatement.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">First, I will state that this was way better than the second Jurassic World. It was great seeing the big three back obliviously. Additionally, getting rid of the over splicing tendency was a positive trend. It was cool seeing familiar and new ""historic"" dinosaurs along with the more recent idea that many had feathers (though I prefer the more reptile look). That was about all that this movie did well. The main problems:<br/><br/>1. Way too much focus on the locusts, and using them as a big part of the plot.<br/><br/>2. The light ""Star Warization"" of the Jurassic Park past: a). The original characters were somewhat wasted it felt like. B). The strange shoe horning of the Lockwoods that the World franchise's has thrusted upon the series. C.) Cheap/hollow recreates of the old series (the power shutting down, the walkie talkies, the dilophosauruses coming in the sides of the train, etc.)<br/><br/>3. Whatever problems people had with the Lost World (which I loved) and JP III (which I liked), it never made any of the dinosaurs into actual human allies or semi companions. The same cannot be said of this film or the World Series in general. There is human-dino attachment which I don't think is believable, particularly with raptors.<br/><br/>4. Too much snow and cold climates with dinosaurs.<br/><br/>5. A disappointing ending with ""we just must coexist with dinosaurs.""<br/><br/>I was honestly fearing that it would be worse when I went to see it based on how much of a let down the second JW was and how mediocre the first JW was. Treasure the 1st movie. If you like JPIII and/or the Lost World treasure them as well. The Jurassic World Trilogy doesn't even come close to the injustice to Jurassic Park that the latest Star Wars Trilogy attempted to do to Star Wars. You are still left thinking is this the best they could do?</div>

The plot is ehhh. For kids and people who won't notice or care about the predictability and plot armor, they will enjoy it. My kids loved it. The scenes were roller coaster-esque. There were cool Easter eggs scattered throughout the movie, but overall have to give it a 5.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I've been watching Jurassic Park my whole life and never in my life have I ever watched such terrible acting. If you want to see Dr. Fauci in action this movie is it. Between this movies Covid relevancies (Locusts instead of Bats) and terrible acting it makes me feel like I am waking up from a nightmare only to realize it's sadly closer to reality. Never wanted to walk out of a movie, and I only stayed hoping that there was some relevancy to the Jurassic Parks I grew up with. Deeply disappointed. Let's not forget about the raptor dolphin scene either. So terrible I'm dying writing this. Haha Even felt like at some moments I was watching a new Warzone map preview or a new Indian Jones movie with even slight Star Wars vibes towards the end. Which I might add is a great idea...Nazi Dinosaurs maybe? Well that's about the only thing I got out of this movie. No cap. 0/10.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">My husband and I saw this as our first movie in a year. We thoroughly enjoyed it as a fun summer movie. Nothing will equal the original Jurassic Park, but I didn't expect it to. I loved the original cast reunion joining with the Jurassic World group. There were plenty of dinosaurs throughout and I jumped a few times, even though i could have predicted what was coming. Loved the Easter Eggs from the original, especially the open shirt joke for Goldblum/Malcolm.<br/><br/>I can and have seen so many wonderful, serious, Oscar contending movies. Is Dominion one of them? Nope. Is it a fun summer movie, that's great on a big screen? Yup. Relax, go see it with no cares or high expectations, and you'll have a great time at the movies.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Still a great movie, not as good as the first JW, but still really good. The only thing that was disappointing was that this movie didn't seem to focus as much on the dinosaurs and more the humans.<br/><br/>Since I've heard this was the last movie, would have loved to see Tim and Lex return. Oh well, still thoroughly enjoyable and action packed.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I saw it yesterday in 3D and it was amazing. I don't understand the critics ! This movie has everything you want : Tons of dinosaurs, action, a plot that I find good and the nostalgia (the original JP cast, many easter eggs). I think the merge of the two storylines (original JP cast and JW cast) is pretty well done. The special effets are really good. If you like to see dinos on screen and you like JP/JW franchise, go see it in theaters !! You will not be disappointed. I know it supposed to be the conclusion but I really hope that there will be other Jurassic movies !!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">There's a lot of discussion about the final installment of the Jurassic Park/ Jurassic World franchise. Some people love it, some people hate it. I've had the pleasure of seeing it in advance, and here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>Jurassic World: Dominion is the final planned film in the 30 year franchise. It brings back core characters from the original movies and the new cast. It has a lot of work to do, and moves quickly. Honestly, it did everything I, as a fan of this series since Michael Crichton's novel, wanted for the final film. If you're a fan of this series and it's characters, you'll enjoy this one.<br/><br/>Full review with spoilers on my website morbidsmile dot com.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's absolutely wonderful in all the best ways. The reviews are ridiculous, because at the end of the day, it's dinosaurs in the modern world. What did you expect?? Every scene is a homage to a previous film in the franchise. The ending is a little cliche, but just enjoy the ride.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Saw this today in the theater and I kept thinking ""didn't Dodgson die in the first one?"" Wasnt he the attorney eaten by the trex after hiding in a toilet stall? Seems like a pretty big plot hole to me but none of the reviews I checked out said anything about it. Guess I have to go back and re-watch it. I definitely remember the character from the book, but I dont remember what happened to him in the book.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">The first thing that really bugged me was the opening instead of using the really cool epilogue we saw back a couple months on YouTube instead it uses a stupid NOW THIS social media video which recapped the last film. Not only was it really cringey not using the original epilogue was a complete waste of special effects and effort. However one good thing I saw in the film was the implementation of the original cast because it feels completely natural and gives the Originals actual use in the story besides nostalgia (although I do think they push the nostalgia a bit too much but just my subjective opinion). Also I heard a lot of complaints about Social Justice and Woke moments in the film but I don't think it was as bad as people said it was. Now I hate woke moments as much as the next guy but I've seen a lot worse. The strong female characters are handled a lot similarly to previous Jurassic park movies. A problem I had with the previous world movies is how much they humanized the raptors specifically Blue and unfortunately it's still very much in this movie. However they do introduce new raptors that are more scientific accurate that actually act like animals the only that doesn't is blue and her infant. As always the action is really cool but I do wish they killed off a few good guys. Apart from a few random background characters they only characters that die are the bad guys. I wouldve liked to see someone like Malcolm's inside spy to die, or even Dr. Wu similar to the novel. It just felt like the good guys had excessive plot armor. All this to say is that the film is very messy but I feel like most people could enjoy it if they gave it a chance.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">The writing on the wall is pretty clear these days. The few remaining ""Hollywood"" movie studios are clutching desperately to their intellectual properties, gorging a weak script with hundreds of millions of dollars and relying heavily on their audience's nostalgia for happier times. All in order to get a billion dollar payout at the box office. Are you expecting something different when siting down to watch Jurassic World: Dominion?<br/><br/>The answer is, or rather should be, no.<br/><br/>The difference this time. Dino fights. See the matinee, so your 2+ hours of escapist fun doesn't cost more than it should and enjoy the show like I did and move on with your life. Pretty simple.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Love for Jurassic Movies has been with me since the start. I love the excitement, thrill and suspense that comes when I watch any of the movies, However for this movie I was slightly disappointed in the story. I felt that there's was a nonchalant attitude to it. (if you get my meaning). There were few scenes that I did enjoy but overall it didn't meet my expectations.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The characters are all good and so is all the effects so without a doubt You can see it was well made with a big budget.<br/><br/>The negative side of this movie part of the storyline that makes it feel like go happy Disney production aimed for a much younger audience.<br/><br/>Other negative things is that you can almost predict what is going to happen from screen to screen and that they either been lazy or just want to continue with the same typ av camera-shots, angel and close ups as previous Jurassic park movies so there is no surprise there.<br/><br/>Is it worth the money to see this film in the cinema then I would say absolutely not but rather wait until you can rent it online or stream it because this is not really anything else then a cash cow they are milking for the brand name Jurassic park with hope that people are just going to watch it because of the name and earlier versions of it.<br/><br/>There is a few good supering element of this movie but not enough to make this movie worth seeing in the cinema.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">""Above all else, this film is special to me. The whole movie is great at what it does, but... There are three points. Overall the CGI is excellent. Dinosaurs also shine in this movie, but what's more intriguing is the new problem presented. Now that genetics is a powerful weapon, I enjoyed the explanation of new challenges that can be found through this magnificent weapon. And the Cretaceous locusts are proof of that. The soundtrack is good, but it could be better! The filmography is between JW (2015) and JW:FK (2018) but the scenes are very effective and have an excellent masterful touch. There, it should have also worked better on the terror factor (in terms of fright) I think the only scene that causes tension is the one with Therezinosaurus; Pyroraptor's should have been worked on better. The villains are also excellent, every one of them. Lewis is a great villain, I really liked his intro... his weird way fascinates me (as a representative figure of today's entrepreneurs). This movie pleased me in every way and I understand the fact that not all the dinosaurs are on the loose, since it is clear that BioSyn Genetic is responsible for capturing them. Well... this movie is amazing to me, but I feel something is missing; I just don't know what! #JurassicWorldDominion.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">It looks like my opinion will be quite different from the general public's one.<br/><br/>I actually loved the movie, the dinosaurs were perfectly made and it seems like people aren't talking about it as much as it'd be expected, like, they look so real in the movie, it's fascinating, we are experiencing a reality in which dinosaurs are real...<br/><br/>Another thing that's getting me confuse is people complaining about the old characters being given a call back to their roles and getting reunited. Why's that a problem? Shouldn't we (the fans) be grateful for that?<br/><br/>I also read some opinions in which were said that the movie was to much of an action movie. I guess that's what got me stuck to the screen. A lot of breathtaking moments, as it was expected. We already had time to introduce the dinos and the main plot in the past movies, now we need to evolve and develop the history, and that was what they (the writers/directors) did.<br/><br/>I loved the movie and I'm happy i went to the cinema to watch it. It was very entertaining as I was expecting :)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Some great new Dinosaurs to awe over (and they at least act like animals in this as opposed to the brain dead set pieces they were in FK), some great tidying up of mistakes from FK and it's great to see the original cast together.<br/><br/>Some of the character building/dynamics are off but it has its heart in the right place. I enjoyed this movie for what it is.<br/><br/>It redeemed the franchise for me but the next movie needs to be in a park/safari/sanctiary type setting - the open world just doesn't work as well.<br/><br/>Jurassic Kingdom perhaps?</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">That's it, all you need to know. Check your suspension of disbelief at the door and don't pick it back up for a week. Some fun scenes but the dinosaurs could be written out and you'd essentially have the same movie. Actors are good though. They did what they could with the story given. Seeing the original three was charming and nostalgic.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">As a stand alone film it was good, had decent action. The back stories of the characters was nice, and was nice to see three from the original movie. It also had a decent moral message that says don't mess with nature, and has kind of a slap to genetically modified seeds as well. If you go in expecting a lot, you will be disappointed.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">A terrible let down. Too long by at least 30 minutes, the director seemed to try bundling several plots that were just filler.<br/><br/>You definitely need to suspend any concept of time and space considering characters seem to travel from one place to another in no time at all.<br/><br/>Last bone of contention: we saw the 3-d version, everyone around us had issue with the classes not helping at all. I wound up watching without them.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Loved the never shown before new dinosaur species in this movie. Not ""invented"" species either. Good to see all the flashbacks to the older movies, especially the original. Acting was good and the special effects were awesome. Still could have been better, but a good dinosaur movie nevertheless.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Really enjoyed it, obviously watching something else compared to others. Story was good, best since JP. Special effects what you would expect. Great chase. No hybrids in sight. But best of all for dinosaur fans, lots of dinosaurs. Some we've seen before, but lots of new ones too. Must be the most of all the films, which is what you want in a dinosaur film. Cant wait to see it again!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">There are no spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>Jurassic World Dominion take its setting four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Dominion is the grand, spectacular, finale of the Jurassic World trilogy, and the Jurassic Park franchise as a whole. At least... that's what it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>First off, I did not hate the film. It's not a film that I would never watch again in my life. The reason for my slight disappointment, I state below.<br/><br/>CONS:
There are absolutely no character arcs in this film, besides one character, which I won't spoil here. Maisie Lockwood may also have a small arc from her behavior... but that's it. Second off, I thought that this film was too focused on demonstrating action sequences. Rather than exploring the scientific narrative behind the story, it chose to have a jam-packed film filled with action. Sometimes, that's not bad. Colin Trevorrow, the Director of this and the first Jurassic World film, had to please both the action-seeking audience AND the story-seeking audience. I am part of the latter half. So, I understand the action sequences, but it gets overwhelming at points. Focus less on biking/escaping/running/fighting scenes, and concoct a better story! That leads me to my next point. The story feels very hollow and rushed. For a 2-and-a-half-hour-long film, you'd expect the ending to have a magnitude that's different from the ending of the previous film. However, nothing changes. Dinosaurs still roam across the world. Maybe there are two character arcs, but other than that, there's no change from the ending of JW:FK.<br/><br/>PROS:
There is a well-written plot twist midway through the film that I enjoyed watching. It gives some more expansion to the JW ""lore"". Some moments in JWD gave me some seriously intense moments, where I felt like I was going to sweat. Mr. Trevorrow did fantastic on that sweet, sweet, tension. The addition of a few new characters is nice to see. Now, we have the classic characters, the classic JW characters, and the newer characters. Jeff Goldblum is phenomenal in this film and had some humor that made me laugh out loud. A lot of people disliked the locust side story, but personally, I saw it as a way to connect the two stories into one. It was a way to bring the classic characters into the story. I liked that there were also multiple plot lines to follow. Some say that this should have been split into two parts, but these stories happen at the same time, so it would be confusing to have two parts.<br/><br/>Overall, JWD had some major flaws in its production, but I respect and admire the crew's work and struggle through COVID-19. They did the best they could. This movie may not be the best installment, but it's certainly better that JPIII.<br/><br/>Also, this movie doesn't deserve the rotten tomatoes score it has. It's really not THAT bad...</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">....After seeing the film, it remind me of episode 9 from star wars who try too much something to recreat nostalgia and iconic scene and moments from previous film to please the fan ..let say..It had a good time but i expect something different i think. The story go sometime a bit too far with a first act i felt a bit long and boring and the good thing come in the second act because i was a bit scare in the 30 first minutes - acting and editing are sometime very bad and cheesy but in somes moments , it shine specialy in the scene with Grant Malcom or Ellie from the first trilogy , you get nice nostalgia moments between them with amazing actions sequence and special effects. I can describe it like the action in Fast and furious. Its epic in some way but very unrealistic in some scenes still enjoyable most of the time if u forget this. Yes!! There is good moments, very good moments . CGI are good i think except for few scenes because let say , designs for new dinosaures are particuliar and make the blend between CGi and reality more difficult to hide. Its not a step up from the last two last films . Im still impress with the first film that still hold up even today. This film bring no real surprise on the story side and the pacing his very fast , i wish we had more time despite being the longest film in the franchise.<br/><br/>I hope we get a extended cut to answers some elements and directions the story go because there is a lots of characters, new plots , new dinosaures and sometime it seem i miss the attachements or the emotions form previous entry or simplicity . At the end we can say this is a big mashup for fan service . Not to spoil! If u go see the movie for the utimate ending like i did , u wil be surprise actually that it open many doors to more questions or another films maybe.<br/><br/>But if u want to see big action moments with dinos and there is a lots old and news . It delivers ! I think it try too much to please to everyone from the last 5 movies in a complexe story so its a big kraft diner of good and bad thing still a very moving film to watch in Imax.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Disney makes a messy yet entertaining attempt at closing the Jurassic world trilogy. JW1 was pretty good enjoyed it over all besides it being a carbon copy of JP1. JW2 we don't need to talk about. JW3 even with all the hate it seems to be getting was surprisingly entertaining for me. I had low hopes for this movie. Disney has become complacent with their ability to regurgitate films and ideas while painting it with cameos and Easter eggs, LOOKING AT YOU STAR WARS. However, the entire ensemble really made the movie enjoyable! From introducing new characters that had spine and seemed real, unlike JW2, the additions of Dewanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie were solid (loved Ms. Wise in this), Goldblum did his thing but the additions of Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler we're merely for fan service and Disney's addiction to cameos/nostalgia. (Not detracting from the performances given). The story while what you have come to expect from the current Disney model was surprisingly improved not as many tropes and unrelenting call backs that actually allowed the movie to feel slightly fresh. At the end of the day if you haven't seen top gun see that instead but if you enjoy dinosaurs and a good cast this wasn't a bad way to spend an evening getting away from reality. Solid 6/10 for me.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">My actually rating is 7.5/10, this movie felt brilliant at time and other times choppy and blurring like if this was make by two different people. And hate hate the two new black characters they felt so force and honestly had no effect on the plot, one is the pilot and is totally cool about losing her plane like what?! And plus we don't know anything about her still even after watching the movie, and she was cheesy at times useless disappointment and I don't even know her name, that's how boring this one dimensional character is. And the other he was definitely a better actor than her but was teleported around everywhere shoved into every scene possible and I still don't know what his purpose was hahaha. Really slow beginning but pick up at 2 and half act and the 3 act. In my opinion more screen should have been give to the original cast and not introduce any new characters which would improve the movie greatly. It was so good to see Malcolm, Grant, and Ellie back it they weren't there my score would be very low because they made the movie watchable. The villains in this movie were goofy and cartoon and easily forgettable. I don't get why the plot was about stupid clones and not exploring what life is with dinosaurs in the world they were there briefly.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Some of these reviews, I can't seem to fathom or understand. I just watch the movie, and I seemed to have enjoyed it. I wasn't expecting it, as most were. I was surprised with how the director and writers of the movie were gathering most of the past Jurassic park characters together. That was fun to watch. However, what I was disinterested about was the fact that the movie took nearly an hour to build up its action, which was half of its timing. However, that wasn't much of a bug for me. Nonetheless, it was a fun ride and overall, it was a decent movie. Don't listen to some of these reviews!! You enjoy it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I'm a really big fan of Jurassic but I'm really disappointed this time, I won't say that this one was weak I'll say it was quite bad. Music was good overall took me back to the original Park &amp; World movie but very weak story line. No big fight between T-rex and Gignat....... Whatever saurus, Blue and mosasaurus wasted.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Releasing it in a version that includes the prologue and the short movie Battle at big Rock,otherwise it will be a serious letdown to everyone who is a fan of the franchise.it would also help to shorten it down by cutting out several character scenes ,especially the human villains and or additional characters.<br/><br/>Although i lowered my expectations and was already disappointed by its predecessor i felt kinda betrayed by it.my 7 out of 10 rating is really well meant because it belongs to the franchise that i adore ,but it lacked dinosaur action and epicness.especially as a conclusion to the series it unfortunately is a serious disappointment as much as i hate saying that .</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">'Jurassic World' breathed new life into the 'Jurassic Park' franchise. And much like the original, is far and away the best of the trilogy.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for 'Dominion'. After the dinosaurs escaped at the end of 'Fallen Kingdom', and the short that was released a couple years ago that show dinosaurs invading a camp site, I hoped we would get to see how humans and dinosaurs co-exist in the world. But aside from some news clippings at the beginning and end, we really don't see much of it. There is a storyline about there being a black market for dinosaurs, but the main story revolved around....mutant locusts?<br/><br/>Of course an evil corporation is behind it, intent to control the world's food supply.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs kind of take a back seat, and feel like they make more cameos than anything. In fact, I wouldn't be entirely surprised if I found out that there were fewer dinosaurs with less screen time than any other movie. As many as they packed into 'Fallen Kingdom', especially when the volcano exploded, that's how few are in this film. That being said, a dinosaur did provide a pretty good jump scare.<br/><br/>There also didn't real feel like that big, bad ""villain"" dinosaur, like the T-Rex in the original, the Spinosaurus in 3, the Indominus Rex in World, or the IndoRaptor in 'Fallen Kingdom'. They introduce the Giganotosaurus, but it felt more like a throw away than anything.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this isn't necessarily a bad movie, but it just feels like more of a distant relative of 'World'. There was a bit of nostalgia having the original cast back, and the Barbasol can even has a cameo.<br/><br/>If it didn't carry the Jurassic World name, this may have been a more favorable review. But it's really not a great Jurassic Park movie.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">It's definitely not among the best in the series, but I thought it was at times really entertaining with some cool dinosaurs in it. To see old characters back like Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler and Jeff Goldblum was honestly the highlight of the movie. The weakest part of the movie was that at times it felt very slow and long-spun. If it was just a little shorter the pacing would feel better!</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">When it comes to Dino movies, are there any better? Unlike previous ones there are plenty of new dinos that are not hybrids which was good to see. Unlike others I thought the storyline was quite good, yes the end is predictable but what do you expect for a blockbuster that intends to finish a series? Could it be better? Possibly, is it better than Fallen Kingdom, most definitely! First film that I have seen on a big screen in years and I really enjoyed it.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I am so sad to give this awaited movie a 6-star review.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Jurassic Universe.. rewatched all the movies for hundreds times..
but I kinda disappointed with Dominion.<br/><br/>OK, it's really really great to see legendary trio Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm.. but..to watch them as main characters from the beginning until the end, was not really my preference..
I would like to see stronger and more complex Owen, Claire and Maisie stories..
I Would like to see a bad-ass Claire!<br/><br/>I would like to see the Dinosaurus as the villain.. not those damn locust! And dodgson!<br/><br/>Even nobody cares about Dodgson!<br/><br/>Dennis Nedry was right. Nobody cares about Dodgson!<br/><br/>This movie is too many characters.. too many stories..
Meanwhile.. jurassic die hard fans only need 1 thing: Dinosaurus.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think critics are being too hard on this move. I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan, so seeing some of the original cast return was exciting. It's just the the plot is nonexistent and a lot of scenes seemed forced and cringey. Don't get me wrong, it's not unbearable, but I felt they could've done a lot better. It was disappointing that they focused more on the people more than they did the actual dinosaurs. Though I will admit it was cool to see different species on screen, but they didn't get enough screen time unfortunately. While I liked this one better than Fallen Kingdom and was able to enjoy it with the action scenes and nostalgia, a lot of the writing really downgraded it.</div>

The story was all over the place and not a good one. Half the story was not necessary and felt forced. They tried to make it like a Jason Bourne movie but failed. They focused more on bugs than dinosaurs. The new dinosaurs were so stupid looking, full of feathers and hairy. It felt like they just threw a bunch of crap together and said ""We don't care, it'll make money regardless"". Very disappointed.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I wish they kept more things that were cut from the original piece. People forgot that this isnt the og trilogy. If you go to see this movie thinking its a jp film you're failing it without trying. You have to realize the original is over. We're in a new era. Without spoilers I wish they kept a large amount of cut scenes. Not only do I want to see more dinosaurs they cut some cool ones. Only big complaints is beta looks a bit stiff in some scenes and while I understand the story is about locusts I feel they got a bit too much screen time.</div>

Ian is in Fallen kingdom). The plot is a bit weak with a lot of the film being taken up by the Locusts. I feel like Lewis Should've had a better death even though the way he does pays homage to Jurassic Park in the way Dennis Nedry Dies. I love seeing the Barbsol Can return. It also doesn't really Feel like a Jurassic film but it's good for it to be different.</div>

Easy to follow if you've seen a jurassic movie before cool to see the dinosaurs. Chris pratt was grate and cool to see his hand wave to control dinosaurs again in fact the whole cast was awesome.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Bringing back the original cast of Jurassic Park works very well in this film and is one of the rare good things about this movie. The action sequences are terrific and the pacing of this movie is perfect. Some things that didn't work out in this film were its obsession with cliché raptor 'Blue'. Leave her alone already! And the plot itself which was stupid and pointless to begin with. Overall, it's a good film to watch it at least once or twice.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I had seen the reviews and youtube videos before watching this film and had low expectations.<br/><br/>Even though I wasn't a fan of the locust plot, I overall had a good experience. I was expecting ""planet of the apes"" with dinosaurs. The characters were likable and it was nice to see Grant and Ellie get together. Chris and Bryce and the Maisie character did a good job too. I'm glad Henry Wu was redeemed because I never saw him as a villain (he was just a scientist working at the original park).<br/><br/>Though there's not as much dinosaur action as the other movies, they still grab your attention with their beauty and ferocity. The music was excellent as with the other films. Gave me Indiana Jones vibes.<br/><br/>Would recommend if you're a fan of the franchise or you just want to have a good time.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Honestly, it was a big disappointment. The plot was terrible, nothing made sense, the dialogue was not on par ... rather silly and lacked any passion. There was no emotional connection with any of the dinosaurs or characters. I thought I bought tickets to see a Jurassic Park/World movie about dinosaurs, not a James Bond or Borne Identity movie focused on large locusts destroying crops to eventually impact the entire world population into starvation.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs are ... putting it lightly, the supporting actors, not the main attraction to the finale of a huge franchise about ""dinosaurs"".<br/><br/>Very bad, very dissatisfied. Maybe it's my fault because my expectations were to see a movie about, you guessed it ... dinosaurs.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">This is a good movie in general. Mostly. The story was the main issue. Very wonky pacing, and a semi predictable story, and occasionally poor writing. But as a Jurassic movies fan, you'll probably have at least a semi-decent time. The jokes were pretty good, but sometimes they didn't land. It's half dinosaur sequences, 1/4th sprinkling of exposition and dialogue, and 1/4th both. Mostly enjoyable characters, extremely cool prehistoric animals, and if ya like action movies, you will love this movie. The epitome of a summer blockbuster.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">People here forget that they go to the movie ""Jurassic World"" and not Jurassic Park, The movie was the best ending that a trilogy can hope for, You can see all the work they put in the tiny details through all the movie I mean they even put the damn shaving foam beside that you can see how they work so hard on the realistic dinosaurs and the shots was literally the beautiful thing I've ever seen
Really amazing movie, amazing closure and the most brilliant trilogy off all times .<br/><br/>Thank you for reading.</div>

all my families that watched just hate it..
what a disaster way to end the saga..</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Okay start from the story yeah they did something different which was about control as this movie titled dominion and we can clearly watch it in the movie , the story was basically all about the epidemic that caused by the locusts and our heros were trying to stop biosyn from doing all this because they wanted to control the food chain using locust and in this dinosaurs were the major hurdles and yeah of course dodgeson and biosyn as well but what this movie lack of was the end battle was completely short and quick and the rest of the movie the nostalgia , the background score , jumpscares , cgi , music and direction was damn fantabulous , made for the theatres.<br/><br/>By Vansh Verma.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I wasn't even alive when the originals came out. However I still watched all the movies and loved them so much. This one didn't really feel like a jurassic movie. All of the other 5 movies had like one big bad dino in it. That was the bad guy. This one it kinda felt like the dino were a after thought. It a little confusing how much time has past between this one and the last one. The last one leads you to believe that the dino they let go are the last ones. Then in this movie dino are just as common as a dog. However all and all it a ok movie i got a little bored in theaters around the one hour mark then it started to pick back up again. As a fan of the series i walked away going that was a ok ending. Now let hope they don't make jurassic universe: dino in space.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">There are definitely some amazing action sequences in this movie, but to be honest there was little imagination in advancing the plot of the series, and the movie ended EXACTLY where it began.<br/><br/>After two years of post-apocalyptic real world events I was just super frustrated that the writers re-used variations of previous locations and plots.<br/><br/>Really, Dinosaurs are out in the world, people are likely eating them, and no one thought of a Wuhan market type pandemic as a result?

<div class=""text show-more__control"">To be honest, I quite like the movie. Perhaps the movie could be better, but you'd already have a good expectation of what this movie is before watching it due to its long history and its clear central plot. I went to watch my favorite characters coming back to life, and the movie has done that well, it has reached its entertaining purpose. From another perspective, you look at the imaginary world where human being and dinosaur co-exist, it sort of reflects how we have battled with COVID-19 the last two years and found ways to make peace with It.<br/><br/>All in all, the plot is simple and straightforward, the cast is top-notched, the action is great and it integrates reflections of some revolutionary agricultural practices we are adopting these days.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">This was BAD pretty much the same cast as the previous one's. Jeff Goldblum is still his same old arrogant annoying self. In the rendition the dinosaurs pretty much live amongst us we are cohabitating on the planet. Again Goldblum is soooooooo ANNOYING with his sarcasm and 1 liners it made me cringe. I am done with this franchise I got a refund/credit from the theater as well. This was bad very predictable ho hum.......you have been warned.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">Starting info: Now i can definitely see why this movie is getting bad reviews, and low ratings, From the first half an hour, the movie is unbelievably and unbearably BORING, it all face paced, yet so slow.. Once it starts to take off, it becomes super overwhelming and hard to process because of how scrambled and fast paced all the action sequences are.. (1/6)<br/><br/>Plot: The plot isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to seem, but it is definitely NOT executed well, it is fairly predictable, and cliche. Which makes the film NOT feel like a jurassic park/movie in anyway possible. (2/6)<br/><br/>Characters and acting:
I absolutely loved the acting from Chris pratt, dewanda wise &amp; Sam Neil!, although the downsides were that the original trio didnt seem recognizable at ALL! Ellie sattler just seemed like an over dramatic b*tch, Alan grant just looked like an old sad fart who's still has a love interest after like 40 years, and i feel like ian malcom was just there just because it wouldnt make sense to have the other 2 original characters and not him there so they just through him in there for the sake of it , even though in the movie it feels like he was only shown for like 6 minutes.<br/><br/>And the villains were super cliche, corny and stupid!, they just made the movie so much worse than it needed to be! (3/6)<br/><br/>Action:
The action in this movie is top notch, but once again, theres too much happening, you either get confused, or you get overwhelmed. The dinosaur fights were short as all hell and underwhelming, ESPECIALLY the last fight scene. But the suspence is awesome! Some scenes send chills down your spine, but could have been done alot better. (4/6)<br/><br/>Ending:
After a very short and underwhelming battle between dinosaurs, the main characters find themselves back in an airport, safe and sound which doesnt feel satisfying one bit.. it feels like a half of the movie was unfinished, or like you won a competition but know you cheated. It just doesnt feel genuine and completed. (5/6)<br/><br/>All in all, if you are someone who wants to see alot of dinosaur action, want to relax on a weekend and go watch a movie with your friends, Go check it out. Just dont go expecting some movie thats going to have a reward for 10/10 drama, acting and storyline. Just go enjoy it! (6/6)</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Must start out by saying that I adore this franchise and always will and this movie is a good addition but not great. First things first I thought the acting was great throughout and Kayla Watts is a great new Character. Alot of positives but I will just discuss my biggest issue with this movie as a fan......the first Jurassic Park was all about the Dinosaurs being animals and the end battle sequence with the original T-Rex (Rexy) seemingly teaming with the Therizinosaur was so corny and took the animal aspect out. I understand Blue and the Raptors showing those characteristics. I will definitely buy this entry when it comes out on blue-ray but I have to say that this should be the last movie but it won't be.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">Plz watch the movie in 4DX + 3D, you will thank me later. It gives you a full 2.5 hrs universal studio ride experience. (Without 2-hr queue for a 10 mins ride, yes I'm talking about Shriek 4D) Everyone seemed to enjoy the movie coz the whole audience applauded at the end of the movie. I can see why ppl think it's not as good when watching it in a regular 2D theater, this movie is designed for you to watch it in 4DX+ 3D. The thrills when you feel you were actually in it with the casts while running, escaping..etc, the whole experience was so vivid and so worth it. Highly highly recommended!</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">I enjoyed the idea of the first one. Jurassic World was a great concept and panned out very well. Dominion took the key idea of Jurassic World and put it in a different situation with the main characters, not the best idea, but it was still a decent film.<br/><br/>This third movie came out of nowhere. The dialogue was unnatural, lacking in personality and depth. Making what was three dimensional characters in to one dimensional. Any added characters were simple and lacking in depth. One of the most frustrating portions was bringing back the classic three characters and completely ruining their them. All actors could not save the script with their skill, nor could the director with his. The biggest flaw was in its very foundation, the script. The plot itself is a story of agricultural control and demise... with dinosaurs and a clone.<br/><br/>The VFX, the acting, the direction, and the action were there. That is why I give it a 5 star rating. It still had key components that would make a film good. But a film can only be as good as it's base foundation, no matter how much money and fame you throw at it. It is truly unfortunate that this film felt like a cash grab. I hope that if they want to proceed in making any more films in the Jurassic Park franchise, they focus on what the original was.</div>

It does have some boring and unnecessary scenes but it was truly a great movie not quite in the same level as jurrasic park and first 2 jurrasic world.<br/><br/>It brings together both parts of the beloved franchise in a really great way.<br/><br/>100% worth watching.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control"">A film with a lot of scenaristic inconcistencies which wants to play with people's nostalgy. The iconic tensions from the Jurassic Park given by the dinos of the franchise is not present. Still entertaining and graphically okay.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">My 8 years old son loved the entire movie. He likes the raptors and the dynasours fights.<br/><br/>As for me who watched all the previous ones it felt it is just purely commercial addition. They brought the old cast back with no clear role (compared to Spider-Man no way home where it was funny and has a purpose.).<br/><br/>Overall still entertaining for new generation.</div>

<div class=""text show-more__control"">I think I speak for a lot of people when I say I wanted to see the spinosaurus, but the most they decided to give us was a skeleton on grants shelf. Cool Easter egg, and I know that it would of kinda messed up the gigas whole big bad guy of the movie thing, but still. I guess I just hyped myself up to much but for reason, at least. I remember in an interview with Laura Dern, she said ""every dinosaur that were in the previous movies are gonna be in this one"" it's kinda hard to leave out the spino, as it got a pretty decent fanbase after it's appearance in jp3. They could of made the spino fight the giga at the end, but instead had a theri help out rexy. ""Oh well the spino is in camp Cretaceous, just go watch that"" I wanna see s 2022 live action version, not some TV-Y7 animated one chase around a bunch of kids. It makes me more sad because this movie was ""the epic conclusion"" of the franchise, so we probably won't see mr spino again. I don't know, I guess I just overhyped myself. Good movie overall tho.</div>

<div class=""content"">
<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">To me, this ending made the most sense given all that we've seen and done over the course of the previous 5 movies. We've seen the big dinosaur fights. We've seen the genetically modifed dinosaurs. We've seen the main characters in dino danger many many many times. We even got to see the park come together the way we knew it could be. I understand it's what we love, but with this being the very last movie, I know they had to be careful about tying up loose ends while also keeping us entertained.<br/><br/>To me, this type of ending made the most sense. The nostalgia factor was high and I thought that was a really good move to include the OG cast. We have our closure and we feel good about all they've accomplished. The park has been done, the dinos being released into the ""real world"" has been done - what was left other than to close up the genetics storyline and make sure we understood that the dinos weren't going anywhere? You can't put it all back in the box, so there was nowhere else left to go.<br/><br/>I guess I just don't see what people were expecting. There was plenty of action given. We've had all the wow moments we wanted, and I felt this movie did a decent job at giving us Dino scares mixed with real story. Was the ""magic"" there? Not exactlyyyy- and while I appreciate the nods to previous movies with the dino fights, it did feel a bit lazy. But it's the end so I didn't go in expecting some big twist and surprise. We knew what was coming and needed it to be wrapped up tightly, give a nod to all that we've seen and done and that came before us, and say goodbye. I felt this did exactly that and nothing more, so I appreciate it.</div>
